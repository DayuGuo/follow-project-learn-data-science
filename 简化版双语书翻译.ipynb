By the time when it came to be written it was obvious that there would be great difficulty in getting it published (in spite of the present book shortage which ensures that anything describable as a book will “sell”), and in the event it was refused by four publishers. Only one of these had any ideological motive. Two had been publishing anti-Russian books for years, and the other had no noticeable political colour. One publisher actually started by accepting the book, but after making the preliminary arrangements he decided to consult the Ministry of Information, who appear to have warned him, or at any rate strongly advised him, against publishing it. Here is an extract from his letter:\n",
      "这本书的核心思想首先于1937年得到构思，但直到大约1943年底才写下来。当它准备写作时，显然会很难被出版（尽管目前书籍短缺会确保任何称得上书的东西都会“卖出”），结果它被四家出版商拒绝了。其中只有一家出版商存在意识形态动机，另外两家出版商多年来一直出版反俄罗斯的书籍，另一家则没有明显的政治色彩。其中一家出版商实际上开始接受这本书，但在进行初步安排后，他决定咨询信息部，后者似乎警告了他，或者至少强烈建议他不要出版这本书。以下是他的信中的一段摘录：\n",
      " 80%|███████████████████████████████████▏        | 8/10 [00:22<00:09,  4.70s/it]This kind of thing is not a good symptom. Obviously it is not desirable that a government department should have any power of censorship (except security censorship, which no one objects to in war time) over books which are not officially sponsored. But the chief danger to freedom of thought and speech at this moment is not the direct interference of the MOI or any official body. If publishers and editors exert themselves to keep certain topics out of print, it is not because they are frightened of prosecution but because they are frightened of public opinion. In this country intellectual cowardice is the worst enemy a writer or journalist has to face, and that fact does not seem to me to have had the discussion it deserves.\n",
      "这种事情不是好的征兆。很明显，政府部门不应该对未经官方赞助的书籍进行任何审查的权力（除了在战时没有人反对的安全审查）。但是，思想和言论自由在此时面临的主要危险不是MOI或任何官方机构的直接干预。如果出版商和编辑尽力在印刷品中避免某些话题，那并不是因为他们害怕起诉，而是因为他们害怕公众舆论。在这个国家，知识分子的懦弱是作家或记者必须面对的最严重的敌人，而这一事实似乎没有得到应有的讨论。\n",
      " 90%|███████████████████████████████████████▌    | 9/10 [00:33<00:06,  6.28s/it]Any fairminded person with journalistic experience will admit that during this war official censorship has not been particularly irksome. We have not been subjected to the kind of totalitarian “co-ordination” that it might have been reasonable to expect. The press has some justified grievances, but on the whole the Government has behaved well and has been surprisingly tolerant of minority opinions. The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary.\n",
      "任何有新闻的公正人士都会承认，在这场战争期间，官方审查并不是特别烦人。我们没有遭到类似极权主义“协调”的困扰，这是可以合理预期的。新闻界有些合理的抱怨，但总体来说，政府表现得很好，对少数派观点非常宽容。英国文学审查的不可思议之处在于它基本上是自愿的。\n",
      "100%|███████████████████████████████████████████| 10/10 [00:40<00:00,  6.61s/it]Unpopular ideas can be silenced, and inconvenient facts kept dark, without the need for any official ban. Anyone who has lived long in a foreign country will know of instances of sensational items of news – things which on their own merits would get the big headlines – being kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervened but because of a general tacit agreement that “it wouldn’t do” to mention that particular fact. So far as the daily newspapers go, this is easy to understand. The British press is extremely centralised, and most of it is owned by wealthy men who have every motive to be dishonest on certain important topics. But the same kind of veiled censorship also operates in books and periodicals, as well as in plays, films and radio. At any given moment there is an orthodoxy, a body of ideas which it is assumed that all right-thinking people will accept without question. It is not exactly forbidden to say this, that or the other, but it is “not done” to say it, just as in mid-Victorian times it was “not done” to mention trousers in the presence of a lady. Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with surprising effectiveness. A genuinely unfashionable opinion is almost never given a fair hearing, either in the popular press or in the highbrow periodicals.\n",
      "不受欢迎的想法可以沉默，不方便的事实可以被保密，而无需任何官方禁令。在外国生活过的人，会知道有些轰动新闻（本应是头条新闻）却被英国媒体刻意地隐瞒，并非是政府的干预，而是自发形成的一种默认协议：某些特定事实“不宜”被提及。日报的做法是容易理解的。英国的新闻界极度集中，其大部分归富有的人所有，在某些重要的话题上他们有不诚实的动机。但是，这种含蓄的审查制度也适用于书籍、期刊、电影、广播等方面。在任何特定的时间点上，都存在着一种正统思想，也就是一个人们默认认可而不需质疑的思想体系。并没有严格禁止说出这个、那个或那个，只是不“适合”去提及，就像在维多利亚时代，男士在女士面前谈论长裤是“不合适的”一样。任何挑战主流正统思想的人都会因为这种思想的力量而被有效地控制和压制。真正不合时宜的观点几乎不会在大众媒体或高端期刊上获得公正的审视。\n",
      "11it [01:01, 10.72s/it]                                                         At this moment what is demanded by the prevailing orthodoxy is an uncritical admiration of Soviet Russia. Everyone knows this, nearly everyone acts on it. Any serious criticism of the Soviet régime, any disclosure of facts which the Soviet government would prefer to keep hidden, is next door to unprintable. And this nation-wide conspiracy to flatter our ally takes place, curiously enough, against a background of genuine intellectual tolerance. For though you are not allowed to criticise the Soviet government, at least you are reasonably free to criticise our own. Hardly anyone will print an attack on Stalin, but it is quite safe to attack Churchill, at any rate in books and periodicals. And throughout five years of war, during two or three of which we were fighting for national survival, countless books, pamphlets and articles advocating a compromise peace have been published without interference. More, they have been published without exciting much disapproval. So long as the prestige of the USSR is not involved, the principle of free speech has been reasonably well upheld. There are other forbidden topics, and I shall mention some of them presently, but the prevailing attitude towards the USSR is much the most serious symptom. It is, as it were, spontaneous, and is not due to the action of any pressure group.\n",
      "此刻普遍正统主义所要求的是对苏联的盲目赞美，这是人人皆知的，几乎每个人都在按此行动。对苏联政权进行任何严肃的批评，揭露任何苏联政府希望隐瞒的事实，都几乎是不可印刷的。而这种全国范围内的谄媚盟友的阴谋，竟然在真正的知识分子思想宽容的背景下发生。因为虽然你不能批评苏联政府，但至少你可以相对自由地批评我们自己的政府。几乎没有人会发表对斯大林的攻击，但在书籍和期刊中攻击丘吉尔是相当安全的。更令人不可思议的是，经历了五年的战争，其中有两三年我们为了国家的生存而战，却出版了无数的倡导妥协和平的书籍、小册子和文章，而没有受到任何干扰。更重要的是，它们被出版且没有引起太多的反感。只要不涉及苏联的声望，言论自由的原则就得到了比较好的维护。还有其他被禁止的话题，我稍后会提到，但对苏联的普遍态度是最严重的症状。它是一种自发的现象，不是任何压力团体的行为造成的。\n",

      "当我在2009年夏天从克利夫兰搬到芝加哥的时候，我不知道自己需要交朋友。我当时21岁，严肃而孤僻，真心觉得自己不需要其他人。我搬到城市读研究生，以为我可以把所有精力都投入到课程和研究中，不去考虑其他事情。\n",

I had excelled academically, and living a “life of the mind” kept me from worrying too much about my many problems. I had an eating disorder that had ravaged my digestive system, and gender dysphoria that made me resent how other people saw me, though I didn’t yet understand why. I didn’t know how to approach people or initiate conversations, and I didn’t care to learn, because most interactions left me feeling irritated and unheard. The few relationships I did have were enmeshed; I took responsibility for others’ problems, tried to manage their emotions for them, and lacked any capacity to say “no” to unreasonable requests. I didn’t know what I wanted out of life, other than to become a professor. I didn’t want a family, I didn’t have hobbies, and I believed I was incapable of really being loved. But I was getting good grades and my intellect earned me a lot of praise, so I just focused on those strengths. I pretended all the rest was a meaningless distraction.\n",
      "到那时为止，独处对我来说效果很好。我在学业上表现出色，“生活在思想中”让我不会过分担心我的许多问题。我有一种吃东西失调症，它摧毁了我的消化系统和性别焦虑，让我厌恶别人如何看待我，尽管我当时还不理解其中的原因。我不知道如何接近人或发起对话，也不想学习，因为大多数互动让我感到恼怒和被忽视。我所拥有的几段关系都纠缠在一起，我承担了别人的问题，试图为他们管理情绪，缺乏拒绝不合理请求的能力。我不知道自己想要什么样的生活，除了成为教授。我不想要家庭，没有爱好，相信自己无法真正被爱。但我成绩不错，我的智力赢得了很多赞誉，所以我只专注于这些优点。我假装其他所有的都是无意义的干扰。\n",

The few times I did, I had to get completely hammered to overcome my inhibitions and seem “fun.” Otherwise I spent whole weekends alone in my apartment, reading journal articles and falling down strange internet rabbit-holes. I didn’t let myself have hobbies. I barely exercised or cooked. I’d occasionally hook up with people if I wanted sex or even just a little attention, but every interaction was impassive and rote. I had no sense of myself as a multifaceted human being.\n",

I’d spend an hour sitting in the shower while the hot water rained down on me, lacking the will to stand up. I had trouble speaking to other people. I couldn’t think of any research ideas and lost all interest in what I was studying. One of my supervisors chewed me out for rolling my eyes at her during meetings. At night bone-shaking sobs of despair and overwhelm would overtake me, and I’d pace around my room, whimpering and striking myself in the temples with the heels of my hands. My solitude had somehow become imprisoning, but I was too lacking in social skills or emotional self-awareness to get myself out of it.\n",
      "那一年的冬天，我变成了一个孤独、孤立的垃圾。我会在淋浴时坐上一个小时，热水淋下来，没有站起来的意愿。我与其他人交流困难。我想不出任何研究想法，对我所学的内容失去了兴趣。我的一个主管因我在会议上翻白眼而责骂我。晚上，无边的绝望和压倒性的悲伤会袭击我，我会在房间里踱来踱去，低声哭泣，用手掌打自己的太阳穴。我的孤独变成了一种囚禁，但我缺乏社交技巧或情感自我意识，无法让自己走出困境。\n",

How was I supposed to know I needed friends, and a life? How could I go about connecting with others, when every effort was so unsatisfying? What did I actually enjoy or care about? Around people, I felt I had to censor every natural reaction, and pretend to have interests and feelings that were normal. Plus, people were so overwhelming. They were all so loud and erratic, their eyes like painful laser beams boring into me. All I wanted to do was sit in the dark and not be bothered or judged.\n"

My family went there every single year. We were a family that loved our routines. I was sitting in a hot tub with my cousin, who had recently gone away to college and found the transition very challenging. He confessed to me that he’d recently been assessed for Autism. I had just completed my PhD in social psychology, so he wanted to know if I had any knowledge about Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n",

A therapist had floated Autism as a likely explanation. Then my cousin pointed out all the Autistic traits he’d noticed were common in our family. We didn’t like change. None of us could handle talking about our emotions and mostly interacted using a surface-level script. Some of us had hang-ups about food textures and strong flavors. We rambled on and on about the subjects that interested us, even if it bored others to tears. We were easily overwhelmed by change and rarely went out into the world to have new experiences or make friends.\n",
      "我的表兄跟我谈起了他所遇到的所有问题——很难与同学沟通，感到迷茫和过度刺激。一位治疗师提出自闭症是一个可能的解释。然后我的表兄指出，他在我们家族中发现了一些自闭症特征。我们都不喜欢改变。没有人能处理我们的情绪，并且大多数人使用表层脚本进行交互。我们中的一些人有关于食物口感和强烈的味道的嗜好。我们会冗长地谈论自己感兴趣的主题，即使这使其他人感到厌倦。我们很容易被改变所压倒，并且很少走出去去体验新的经历或交朋友。\n",

I didn’t want any of it to be true because in my mind, Autism was a shameful, life-ruining condition. It made me think of people like Chris, an uncoordinated, “cringey” Autistic kid I’d gone to school with whom nobody had treated well. Autism made me think of withdrawn, prickly TV characters like Benedict Cumberbatch’s Sherlock, and the Big Bang Theory’s Sheldon. It called to mind nonverbal children who had to wear big clunky headphones to the grocery store and were viewed as objects rather than people. Though I was a psychologist, all I knew about Autism was the broadest and most dehumanizing of stereotypes. Being Autistic would mean I was broken.\n",
      "当我表姐告诉我所有这些，我感到恐惧。我不想任何一件事是真实的，因为在我心中，自闭症是一种耻辱的、毁掉生命的状况。这让我想起像克里斯这样的人，一个我去过学校的不协调、“让人感到不舒服”的自闭症孩子，没有人对他们好。自闭症让我想到像本尼迪克特·康伯巴奇的夏洛克和《生活大爆炸》的谢耳朵那样孤僻多疑的电视角色。它唤起了那些不会说话，不得不佩戴厚重耳机到杂货店的孩子们的记忆，他们被视为物品而不是人。尽管我是一名心理学家，但我对自闭症的了解仅限于最广泛和最贬低的刻板印象。成为一个自闭症患者意味着我是“有缺陷”的。\n",

I inhaled journal articles, blog posts, YouTube videos, and diagnostic assessment materials. I kept this obsessive reading mostly hidden from my then-partner, the way I kept all my deepest fixations hidden from people in my life. I soon learned that itself was a trait common among Autistics; we tend to latch on to subjects that fascinate us and focus on them with a fervor others find weird. After being mocked about our passions, we become secretive about our special interests. Already I was thinking about Autism in terms like we and us; I saw myself clearly reflected in the community, a fact that scared and exhilarated me.\n",

But I’d had many other special interests in the past. I remembered being passionate about bat watching and horror novels as a child. Kids and adults alike had chided me for being too “weird” and “hyper” about those interests. I was “too much” in so many ways. To other people, my tears were immature tantrums and my opinions were condescending diatribes. As I grew up, I learned to be less intense, less embarrassing—less me. I studied other people’s mannerisms. I spent a lot of time dissecting conversations in my head, and I read up on psychology so I could understand people better. That was why I’d gotten a PhD in social psychology. I had needed to carefully study the social norms and patterns of thinking that seemingly felt natural to everybody else.\n",

There was an entire movement led by Autistic people who argued we should view the disability as a perfectly normal form of human difference. These thinkers and activists said our way of being wasn’t wrong at all; it was society’s failure to adapt to our needs that left us feeling broken. People like Rabbi Ruti Regan (author of the blog Real Social Skills) and Amythest Schaber (the creator of the Neurowonderful video series) taught me about neurodiversity. I came to recognize that many disabilities are created or worsened by social exclusion. Armed with this knowledge and a growing sense of self-confidence, I started meeting Autistic people in real life, posting about Autism online, and attending local meetups for neurodiverse people.\n"

As children, these Autistic folks had been visibly awkward, but they were mocked for it instead of given help. Like me, they had developed coping strategies to blend in. Things like staring at a person’s forehead to simulate eye contact, or memorizing conversational scripts based on exchanges they saw on TV.\n",

Others became incredibly passive, because if they toned down their personalities, they wouldn’t have to risk being too “intense.” Beneath the inoffensive, professional veneers they had developed, their lives were falling apart. Many of them suffered from self-harm, eating disorders, and alcoholism. They were trapped in abusive or unfulfilling relationships, with no clue how to feel seen and appreciated. Nearly all of them were depressed, haunted by a profound sense of emptiness. Their entire lives had been shaped by mistrust in themselves, hatred of their bodies, and fear of their desires.\n",

Autistic women, transgender people, and people of color often had their traits ignored when they were young, or have symptoms of distress interpreted as “manipulative” or “aggressive.” So did Autistic people who grew up in poverty, without access to mental health resources. Gay and gender nonconforming men often didn’t fit the masculine image of Autism well enough to be diagnosed. Older Autistics never had the opportunity to be assessed, because knowledge about the disability was so limited during their childhoods. These systematic exclusions had forced an entire massive, diverse population of disabled people to live in obscurity. This gave rise to what I am now calling masked Autism—a camouflaged version of the disorder that’s still widely neglected by researchers, mental health providers, and Autism organizations that aren’t led by Autistic people, such as the much-reviled Autism Speaks.\n",
      "我注意到有明显的模式，即哪些自闭症患者会遭受这种命运。自闭症女性、跨性别者和有色人种在年轻时常常被忽视其特质，或者其症状被解释为“操纵”或“攻击性”。在贫穷中长大、没有接触到心理健康资源的自闭症患者也是如此。同性恋和非符合性别的男性通常不符合自闭症的男性形象而无法得到诊断。年迈的自闭症患者从未有过被评估的机会，因为他们的童年期关于这种残疾的知识非常有限。这些系统性的排斥迫使整个庞大而多样化的残疾人口生活在默默无闻中。这导致了我现在所说的假面自闭症 - 一种掩盖的障碍形式，研究人员、心理健康服务提供者和未由自闭症人士领导的自闭症组织（如备受诟病的自闭症之声）仍然广泛忽视的障碍。\n",

Since Autism is a pretty complex and multifaced disorder, that covers a lot of different traits, which can manifest in many different ways.

Even within that relatively privileged class, it’s almost exclusively wealthy and upper-middle-class Autistic kids who get identified.[1] That group has always been the prototype for Autism when it’s described by clinicians or depicted in media. All the diagnostic criteria for Autism are based on how it presents in this group. Every Autistic person is hurt by this narrow conception of the disorder, even the white, rich, cisgender boys who are most likely to be reflected by it. For far too long, we have been defined only by the “hassle” that white Autistic boys caused their well-off parents. Our complex inner lives, our own needs and sense of alienation, the ways that neurotypical people confused, confounded, and even abused us—all were ignored for decades because of this lens. We were defined only by what we seemed to lack, and only insofar that our disabilities presented a challenge to our caregivers, teachers, doctors, and other people who held power over our lives.\n",

They might spend the first few decades of their lives with no idea they’re Autistic at all, believing instead that they’re just shy, or highly sensitive. In recent years, the public has slowly become familiar with the idea that women with Autism exist, and a few excellent books like Jenara Nerenberg’s Divergent Mind and Rudy Simone’s Aspergirls have worked to build awareness of this population. It’s also helped that high-profile Autistic women like comedian Hannah Gadsby and writer Nicole Cliffe have come out publicly as Autistic.\n",

It’s a label that doesn’t properly account for why some Autistics mask their Autistic qualities, or have their needs ignored for years. First, not all women with Autism have the “female Autism” subtype. Plenty of Autistic women visibly self-stimulate, struggle to socialize, and experience meltdowns and shutdowns. Autistic scientist and activist Temple Grandin is a great example of this. She speaks in something of a monotone, avoids eye contact, and even as a young child craved sensory stimulation and pressure. Though she’s very visibly and typically Autistic by today’s standards, Grandin was not diagnosed until adulthood.[3]\n",
      "“女性自闭症”这个概念存在着一个严重问题。这个标签不能很好地解释为什么有些自闭症患者掩饰他们的症状或被忽略了多年的需求。首先，并不是所有女性患者都属于“女性自闭症”亚型。许多女性自闭症患者表现出明显的自我刺激，社交困难以及情绪崩溃和关闭。自闭症科学家和活动家坦普尔·格兰丁就是一个很好的例子。她说话单调，避免眼神交流，甚至在幼年时期就渴望感官刺激和压力。尽管按照现在的标准，她明显而典型地表现出自闭症症状，但直到成年后才被确诊。\n",

Even women with really classically Autistic behaviors may elude diagnoses for years, simply because they are women and their experiences are taken less seriously by professionals than a man’s would be.[4] Additionally, not everyone who has their Autism ignored and downplayed is a female. Many men and nonbinary people have our Autism erased, too. To call the stealthy, more socially camouflaged form of Autism a “female” version of the disorder is to indicate that masking is a phenomenon of gender, or even of assigned sex at birth, rather than a much broader phenomenon of social exclusion. Women don’t have “milder” Autism because of their biology; people who are marginalized have their Autism ignored because of their peripheral status in society.\n"

Maintaining that neurotypical mask feels deeply inauthentic and it’s extremely exhausting to maintain.[5] It’s also not necessarily a conscious choice. Masking is a state of exclusion forced onto us from the outside. A closeted gay person doesn’t just decide one day to be closeted—they’re essentially born into the closet, because heterosexuality is normative, and being gay is treated as a rare afterthought or an aberration. Similarly, Autistic people are born with the mask of neurotypicality pressed against our faces. All people are assumed to think, socialize, feel, express emotion, process sensory information, and communicate in more or less the same ways. We’re all expected to play along with the rules of our home culture, and blend into it seamlessly. Those of us who need alternate tools for self-expression and self-understanding are denied them. Our first experience of ourselves as a person in the world, therefore, is one of being othered and confused.

My social isolation was a way of rejecting other people before they could reject me. My workaholism was a sign of Autistic hyperfixation, as well as an acceptable excuse to withdraw from public places that caused me sensory overwhelm.

It turned out being Autistic wasn’t that rare at all (roughly 2 percent of people are diagnosed with it today, and many more have subclinical traits or cannot access diagnosis).[6] Many individuals in my professional and social circles privately came out to me as neurodiverse as well. I met Autistic people with full-time jobs in visual design, acting, musical theater, and sex education—not fields people associate with our logical, supposedly “robotic” minds. I got to know more Black, brown, and indigenous Autistics, who had long been dehumanized by the psychiatric community. I met Autistics who’d at first been diagnosed with things like Borderline Personality Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, or Narcissistic Personality Disorder.

Many of us share mental health symptoms and traits and have overlapping or comorbid diagnoses. All of us have internalized mental illness stigma and felt the shame of deviating from what’s considered “normal.” Almost every person with a mental illness or disability has been crushed under the weight of neurotypical expectations, and has repeatedly tried and failed to earn acceptance by playing the rules of a game that was designed to harm us.

      "这本书适合任何神经多样性（或怀疑自己是神经多样性）的人，并希望达到新的自我接受水平。神经多样性是一个广泛的伞形词，包括自闭症者、ADHD患者、精神分裂症患者、脑部损伤患者或自恋性人格障碍患者等。尽管这本书的重点是因为掩盖而被自闭症冠以“神经多样性”标签的人，但我发现自闭症者和其他神经多样性群体之间有相当大的重叠部分。我们中的许多人都有相同的心理健康症状和特征，并且有相互重叠或并存的诊断。我们所有人都内化了心理疾病的污名化，并感受到了偏离被认为是“正常”的标准而带来的羞耻感。几乎每个患有精神疾病或残疾的人都曾被神经典型期望的重压所压垮，并反复尝试但未能通过一场旨在伤害我们的游戏规则而获得认同。因此，几乎每个神经多样性的人的自我接受之旅都涉及学习揭开掩盖。\n",

I’ll also explain the history of how Autism has been defined, and how that’s led us to the obscured and estranged place we’re in today. Using the real-life stories of Autistic people, as well as a bevy of psychological research, I’ll illustrate the many ways that masked Autism can present and explain why so many of us never realize we have a pervasive disability until relatively late in life. I’ll discuss how painful a lifetime of masking can be, and point to data showing it takes a real toll on our mental, physical, and relational health.\n",

My hope is that one day, each of us can accept ourselves as the wonderfully weird, mold-breaking individuals we truly are, and live as ourselves, without fear of ostracism or violence. I’ve spoken to a variety of Autistic educators, therapists, coaches, and writers to help develop these resources, have tested them in my own life, and interviewed Autistic people who’ve used them to improve their own lives. These experiences provide concrete examples of what an unmasked (or less-masked) existence really looks like. When you stop judging yourself according to the neurotypical gaze, everything from your relationship norms and daily habits, to the way you dress yourself and design your home is free to change.\n",

You might still be haunted by negative media images of Autism or be worried that unmasking might make you less functional, too strange, or somehow impossible to love. You probably also recognize that there are real, material risks to letting your disability be visible, particularly if you occupy a marginalized position in society. You might associate authenticity with being unsafe for incredibly rational reasons, and not be sure how and when unmasking could be worth it for you. So, let’s first take a moment to consider the positive sides of unmasking, and what a less inhibited life might look like for you.\n"

He certainly isn’t alone in that. Label avoidance (taking steps to evade diagnosis) is a very common consequence of disability and mental health stigma.[1] Publicly identifying as disabled does mean being viewed as less competent—and less human—by many people. As damaging and self-defeating as it can be to camouflage one’s disability status, it is by no means a paranoid act. It’s a rational reflection of the prejudices disabled people face. It’s not unique to Autism, either; many people with mental illnesses[2] and hidden physical disabilities[3] elect to avoid the mark of shame a diagnosis might bring.\n",

Though Crystal’s grandfather intended to protect her from bigotry, and from being infantilized, he also denied her important self-knowledge, educational resources, and a place in the Autistic community. Without consulting Crystal, her family determined it would be better for her to suffer and hide her neurodiversity than to have a name for her marginalized position in the world.

Some of the details change, but the narrative arc is always the same: A child exhibits early signs of difficulty, but their families and teachers balk when disability is raised. Parents or grandparents who themselves have Autism spectrum traits dismiss the child’s complaints, claiming that everybody suffers from the social stress, sensory sensitivities, stomach issues, or cognitive fuzziness they themselves experience. Everyone in the child’s life views disability not as an explanation of how a person functions (and what help they need in order to function), but a sign of damage. So they push the label away, and tell their child to stop making such a fuss. Believing they are helping their child “rise above” a limitation and be tough, they encourage the child not to be visibly odd, or to ever ask for assistance.\n"

They grow into an adult who is even more self-effacing, and even less capable of voicing how they feel.

Regular life actually did require more willpower out of her; Autistic people frequently experience inertia in starting a task,[6] and challenges in breaking complex activities down into small steps that follow a logical sequence.[7] This can make everything from basic household chores to applying to jobs and filing taxes incredibly challenging, or even impossible without help.\n",
      "最后，Crystal找到了一个解释，为什么她完成的任务没有其他人多，以及为什么像去银行或坐两小时的讲座这类基本的任务会让她感到太疲倦无法思考或说话。她实际上需要更多的意志力来应对日常生活；自闭症人士经常会在开始任务时遇到惯性问题，并且在将复杂的活动分解为按照逻辑顺序进行的小步骤时也存在挑战。这可能使从基本家务到申请工作和提交税收申报变得极具挑战性，甚至需要外界帮助才能完成。\n",

Reading a book took her twice as long as the average person. All she had the energy to do at the end of the day was sit in bed and eat french fries.

Until fairly recently, most people believed Autism was rare, that only young boys had it, and that it was always easy to see. Think of Dustin Hoffman’s portrayal in the film Rain Man: he’s institutionalized as a child because he’s profoundly disabled and too “difficult” to have at home, he never gives eye contact, wanders off dangerously when not closely watched, and has a preternatural talent for math that his nondisabled brother exploits for personal gain. This is how all of us were trained to view the disability: a horrible condition that renders you freakish and helpless, your life only as valuable as your savant-like skills are to other people.\n",
      "常常会忽略女性患者（例如 Crystal）患有自闭症的原因之一，是专业人员和公众对自闭症的本质存在基本的误解。直到最近，大多数人仍认为自闭症是罕见的，只有年幼的男孩才患有此病，并且它总是容易被发现。想想达斯汀·霍夫曼在电影《雨人》中的形象：他在童年时期被送进了福利院，因为他有严重的残障，并且太“难以管理”而不能在家里生活，他从不与人眼神接触，没有人或事物能够牵引他的注意力，而他天赋异禀的数学才能被他无残疾的兄弟为个人利益所利用。这是我们所有人被训练去看待这种残疾的方式：一种可怕的状况，让你变得畸形和无助，只有当你的类似天才的技能对他人有用时，你的生命才有价值。\n",

Asperger’s was stereotyped as a “higher functioning” flavor of Autism found in really smart, nerdy, usually rude men who worked in fields like tech. In both forms, Autism was associated with being awkward and uncaring (and male) with a penchant for numbers. People had little to no understanding of Autism’s causes, what it felt like to be an Autistic person, or that the disability shares features with other disorders like epilepsy, Social Anxiety Disorder, Attention-Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).\n",
      "到了20世纪90年代中期，当Crystal还是个孩子时，有些人也对当时所称的亚斯伯格症有一个模糊的认识。亚斯伯格是被刻板印象化为一种“较高功能”的自闭症类型，通常发生在像技术领域那样的非常聪明，书呆子般的男人身上。在这两种形式中，自闭症都被关联在不善交际、无情（以及男性），并倾向于数字的笨拙上。人们对自闭症的原因几乎不了解，也不知道成为一个自闭症患者是什么感觉，或者残疾与其它疾病如癫痫、社交焦虑症、注意力缺陷/多动障碍（ADHD）或创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）有哪些共同点。\n"

In the scientific literature, it’s arguable whether the disability should even be defined by the presence of clear behavioral signs, such as trouble reading social cues or hesitating to initiate contact with other people.[8] Instead of looking to the external signals of Autism that others might pick up on, it’s important that we instead focus on the neurobiological markers of the neurotype, and the internal experiences and challenges that Autistic people themselves report.\n",

Autism is a developmental disability that runs in families[9] and appears to be largely genetically heritable.[10] However, it is also multiply determined, meaning it has no single cause: a whole host of different genes appear to be associated with Autism,[11] and every Autistic person’s brain is unique and exhibits its own distinct patterns of connectivity.[12] Autism is a developmental disability because compared to neurotypical milestones, it comes with delays: many Autistic people continue to grow in their social and emotional skills for much later in life than allistics tend to.[13] (However, this may be due to the fact that Autistic people are forced to develop our own social and emotional coping skills from scratch, because the neurotypical methods taught to us don’t suit how we process information—more on this later.) Autism is associated with specific and pervasive differences in the brain, which result in us diverging from neurotypical standards, in terms of how our brains filter and make sense of information.\n",

Throughout our brains, Autistic people have delayed and reduced development of Von Economo neurons (or VENs), brain cells that help with rapid, intuitive processing of complex situations.[15] Similarly, Autistic brains differ from allistic brains in how excitable our neurons are.[16] To put it in very simple terms, our neurons activate easily, and don’t discriminate as readily between a “nuisance variable” that our brains might wish to ignore (for example, a dripping faucet in another room) and a crucial piece of data that deserves a ton of our attention (for example, a loved one beginning to quietly cry in the other room).

When infants are born, their brains are typically hyperconnected; much of human development is a process of slowly pruning unhelpful connections and becoming more efficient at responding to one’s environment, based on life experience and learning. In Autistic brains, however, researchers have found that some regions remain hyperconnected throughout the life span, whereas other regions may be underconnected (relatively speaking). It is difficult to sum up these connectivity patterns because, as neurobiologists at the Weizmann Institute of Science have found, every Autistic brain exhibits a different connectivity pattern. Our brain wiring appears to actually be more diverse than the wiring of neurotypical brains, which researchers believe have a consistent pruning pattern.[17] The researchers at the Weizmann Institute have theorized that this means Autistic brains respond to our environments differently; whereas neurotypical brains are believed to readily adapt to the sensory and social input they receive from the outside world, Autistic brain development and pruning appears to be “disrupted.”[18]\n",

For example, one series of studies found that Autistic people are far better than allistics at copying down a drawing of a distorted 3-D object that couldn’t exist in real life.[20] Allistics got caught off guard by how impossible and illogical the overall image was, whereas Autistics could just focus on the individual lines and shapes that made up the image, and re-create the drawing from the bottom up. This high degree of attention to detail also applies to how we navigate social situations: we focus on the small features of a person’s face rather than taking in their likeness or emotional expression as a whole, for instance.[21] This helps explain why many Autistic people have prosopagnosia (the inability to recognize faces),[22] and experience difficulty reading emotions on neurotypicals’ faces.\n",

In the United States at least, being gay has started becoming accepted enough that queer people don’t have to justify our existence by saying we can’t help but be this way.

They’ll enter a new environment, such as an unfamiliar restaurant, take a quick look around, and jump to reasonable conclusions about how to order, where to sit, what kind of service to expect, and even how loudly they should talk. Their brains will immediately begin to filter through sounds, lights, and other stimuli, and adjust accordingly. They might notice a clanging pinball machine in the corner for a moment, for instance, but soon habituate to it, and become able to ignore it.

If we’ve never been in a particular restaurant before, we may be slow to make sense of its layout or figure out how ordering works. We’ll need really clear-cut indications of whether it’s the kind of place where you sit down and get table service, or if you’re supposed to go to a counter to ask for what you like. (Many of us try to camouflage this fact by doing extensive research on a restaurant before setting foot inside.) Every single light, laugh, and smell in the place is taken in individually by our sensory system, rather than blended into a cohesive whole. To cope with unpredictability, we analyze our experiences for patterns, and memorize rule sets: if the waiter says X, I reply with Y.

Autism is associated with repetitive self-stimulatory behavior (“stimming”),[31] which can be something as benign as hand-flapping, or as severe as chewing one’s fingers until they bleed. Stimming is an important means of self-regulation. It helps soothe us when we’re anxious or overloaded with stress, and it helps us express joy and enthusiasm. There are a variety of ways to stim, and stimming can make use of any of the five senses. Some of us stim using echolalia, the repeating of words, sounds, or phrases that feel good vibrating in our throats. Others stim by engaging the body’s proprioceptive system (the neural system that tracks the body’s physical movement) by jumping up and down or swaying in place. Sucking on candy, smelling scented candles, staring at lava lamps, listening to recordings of rain and thunder—all of these activities can be stims. All humans stim to an extent (if they didn’t, fidget spinners wouldn’t have become so popular several years ago), but Autistic people stim more frequently, more repetitively, and more intensely than neurotypicals do.\n",

We often eat the same meals over and over again, or only enjoy a limited range of foods (sometimes called samefoods in the community). We hyperfixate on activities that we enjoy and can get so engrossed in them that we forget to eat or take a break to stretch our legs. We echo phrases from movies and TV because they help us emulate “normal” social behavior, or because we lack our own words for how we are feeling, or simply because the sounds feel pleasant to have vibrating in our vocal cords.

The label neurodiverse includes everyone from people with ADHD, to Down Syndrome, to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, to Borderline Personality Disorder. It also includes people with brain injuries or strokes, people who have been labeled “low intelligence,” and people who lack any formal diagnosis, but have been pathologized as “crazy” or “incompetent” throughout their lives.

Though the neurological and mental features of Autism cut across a wide swathe of people, the way it presents is always a bit different. In fact, Autistic traits can manifest in downright paradoxical ways. At times, I can be so intensely focused on a task (such as reading or writing) that the rest of the world entirely drops away. When I’m hyperfixating, I fail to notice things like someone speaking to me or smoke filling the room because I forgot to turn the oven off. At other times, I’m an anxious and distractible wreck, unable to make my way through a single sentence of a book because my pet chinchilla is hopping around in his cage and making the bars rattle. These two very disparate responses have the same root cause: the overexcitability of Autistic people’s neurons and the inconsistent way that we filter stimuli (at least compared to allistics). We tend to be both easily disturbed by sound in our environment, and unable to tell when a noise actually merits our attention, at the same time.[44] I often brute-force my way into paying attention to something by shutting the rest of the world out. I think it’s also likely that lifelong masking has rendered me hypervigilant, almost as a trauma response. My sensory system is used to scanning the environment, to determine whether I’m alone and thus “safe” enough to be myself. Trauma survivors often become hypervigilant, which tends to come with intense sensory issues.[45] Some researchers have also theorized that sensory issues in Autistics are, at least in part, caused by the anxiety and hypervigilance we experience from living in a world that doesn’t accommodate us, and often treats us with hostility.[46]\n"

Some people are also subclinically Autistic, meaning they might not qualify for an official diagnosis, in the eyes of psychiatrists, but share enough struggles and experiences with us that they belong in the community. Relatives of diagnosed Autistic people, for example, frequently are found to exhibit subclinical traits.[47] Of course, what’s considered to be “subclinical” is often more a function of a person’s ability to hold down a job and conform to societal rules than it is a reflection of how much they are suffering.\n",

This remark can feel a bit grating to hear, because it feels like our experiences are being downplayed. It’s similar to when bisexual people get told that “everybody is a little bit bi.” When most people make remarks like these, they’re implying that because our difference is so universal, we can’t actually be oppressed for it, and should just shut up about it. However, I do think that when allistic people declare that everyone is a little Autistic, it means they are close to making an important breakthrough about how mental disorders are defined: why do we declare some people broken, and others perfectly normal, when they exhibit the exact same traits? Where do we draw the line, and why do we even bother doing so? If an Autistic person benefits from more flexibility at work, and more social patience, why not extend those same benefits to everybody? Autistic people are a normal part of humanity, and we have qualities that can be observed in any other non-Autistic human. So yes, everyone is a little bit Autistic. That’s all the more reason to broaden our definition of what is deserving of dignity and acceptance.\n",

Typical Autistics don’t communicate the way neurotypical society wants them to; they might be nonverbal or slow to develop speech, and they avoid gazing at other people or approaching them. They engage in repetitive behaviors that are recognizable: they rock in place, slap themselves in the head, or yell and chirp. Their sensory pain and social overwhelm is near-constant, and they can’t hide how profoundly they’re suffering. Their parents have trouble managing their meltdowns and sensory overloads, seeing these responses as “behavioral issues,” or “noncompliance.” They may complain Autism has “stolen” their once well-behaved baby from them. Typical Autistics are probably boys, and they’re probably white, and they are likely to come from wealthy or upper-middle-class families who can access diagnosis and therapeutic support (and who tend to have pretty restrictive norms of what constitutes “appropriate” public behavior).\n",

The vast majority of Autistic people who have been diagnosed flout this incredibly rigid set of criteria in one way or another.[48] That’s despite the fact all existing diagnostic tools for Autism were developed with wealthy, white, gender-conforming boys in mind. When we consider the evidence that Autism is underdiagnosed in girls, Black, indigenous, Asian, and Latinx people,[49] and those in poverty,[50] among other groups, we can see that “typical” Autism is probably even less typical than official figures would have us believe.\n",

Shutdowns are essentially a way of dissociating from one’s surroundings. It can look like falling asleep very suddenly, becoming unresponsive, or just kind of zoning out (which is how it presented in Crystal’s case). Crystal suspects that had she been an Autistic boy, her shutdowns would have been viewed differently. Boys are supposed to have agency and confidence, and engage actively with the world. Being nonresponsive and depressed might have inspired early intervention, rather than morphing into an unspeakable family secret. Instead, Crystal’s parents told her to stop being “so weird” and to sit up and “look alive.” When confusion and frustration made her want to break down and cry, she was similarly told to tamp those urges down.\n"

These same populations of people also tend to be raised to be more agreeable and pleasant than their white male peers. For example, developmental psychology research has repeatedly noted that even small acts of play-aggression in girls are severely discouraged and punished by their teachers and parents as “inappropriate.” A girl might be admonished for slamming a couple of toys into one another, for example. Meanwhile, most boys are allowed to be rough and sometimes violent in their play.[52] Because girls are held to a much more restrictive social standard than boys are, they learn to hide any troublesome, “violent,” or disruptive Autism features much earlier. Similar dynamics are at play for Autistic people of color and trans Autistic people of a variety of identities, as well as other maskers.[53]\n",

Hans Asperger and other early Autism researchers did study girls on the spectrum, but generally left them out of their published research reports.[55] Asperger in particular avoided writing about Autistic girls because he wanted to present certain intelligent, “high-functioning” Autistic people as “valuable” to the Nazis who had taken over Austria and were beginning to exterminate disabled people en masse. As Steve Silberman describes in his excellent book NeuroTribes, Hans Asperger wanted to spare the “high functioning” Autistic boys he’d encountered from being sent to Nazi death camps. Silberman described this fact somewhat sympathetically; Asperger was a scientist who had no choice but to collude with the fascist regime and save what few children he could. However, more recently unearthed documents make it clear that Asperger was far more complicit in Nazi exterminations of disabled children than had been previously believed.[56] Though Asperger held intelligent, “little professor” type Autistics close to his heart, he knowingly sent more visibly debilitated Autistics to extermination centers.\n",

Girls with disabilities were seen as more disposable, so they were left out of the conversation.[57] Black and brown Autistics weren’t described at all by Asperger or most of his contemporaries, even those who were doing research in more racially diverse countries such as the United States. The existence of LGBTQ and gender nonconforming Autistics was similarly ignored. In fact, the developer of the first therapeutic “treatment” for Autism, Applied Behavioral Analysis therapy, was Ole Ivar Lovaas, who also invented anti-gay conversion therapy.[58] That legacy still haunts the lives of many LGBTQ Autistics, who often feel out of place both in mainstream queer spaces and in Autism groups.[59]\n",

This view influenced how all the diagnostic guidelines were written, and created a feedback loop that endured for decades: the Autistics who got diagnosed were primarily wealthy white boys, and those boys continued to set the standard of what Autism was and how it was understood in the studies that followed.[61] The few white girls who were diagnosed had to be very obviously “masculine” in how their Autism presented.

Though many of us experience sensory issues, anxiety, meltdowns, and debilitating mental health symptoms, we push as much of that misery into the private realm as possible. Our elaborate veils of coping mechanisms and camouflaging can create the illusion we don’t need help. Often this comes at the expense of giving up on the areas of life where we might need assistance. We may eschew relationships, drop out of grueling academic programs, avoid working in fields that require networking and socializing, or completely disengage from activities that involve using our bodies, because we feel so detached and uncoordinated in them.

In the 1990s only one in every 2,500 children was diagnosed.[66] This upward trend shows no sign of stopping, as all evidence suggests the condition is still profoundly underrecognized in women, trans people, Black and brown people, people in poverty, and those without access to screening and therapy. In the United States, as many as 50 percent of all people who need mental health support lack access to it,[67] so we are talking about a truly massive underdiagnosis rate.\n"

My friend Seb (who’s in their mid-twenties) sought out an assessment in the UK and was subjected to tests clearly designed for small kids. A therapist asked Seb to arrange various toys on a table and make up stories about them (this is part of a common diagnostic tool called the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, or the ADOS, and it was developed for use in children).[72] A questionnaire was given to Seb’s mother to fill out, and Seb wasn’t permitted to look at what she’d said. They were completely disempowered by the whole process. Some people whom I interviewed for this book reported being turned away by multiple assessors, for things as simple as being a woman, dressing well, or having voices that weren’t completely monotonous.

They may know, for example, that masked Autistics can make eye contact, though many of us stare too strongly by neurotypical standards, or for too long. They might understand that Autistic women and people of color have to appear friendly as a means of survival, so their tone of voice might not be totally flat. Perhaps they’re even aware of Autism’s link with substance addictions and eating disorders, particularly among people who have to fake neurotypicality all day long at their jobs.

It can come with serious social and legal benefits under the Americans with Disabilities Act (and laws in other countries like it), and other antidiscrimination statutes worldwide. You might hope that people will take your problems more seriously when a psychiatrist has validated them. A formal diagnosis means you can receive disability accommodations at school or work, and you can pursue a legal case if an employer or landlord shows documentable signs of bias against you. In some places a diagnosis can qualify you for a medical marijuana card, or a therapy animal. Family members who have told you that you’re whiny and lazy may finally get off your case when they realize you have a developmental disorder. A therapist or medical care provider may tailor their treatment of you to your neurotype. These are the kinds of outcomes many neurodivergent people hope for when they pursue formal recognition.\n",

Proving in a court of law that you’ve been discriminated against as an Autistic person requires extensive documentation[74] and is prohibitively expensive to pursue for most disabled people. Even though a diagnosed disability entitles you to accommodations on paper, many employers and educators refuse to provide them, or mistreat the employees and students who request them (for more on the limitations of the ADA and its inconsistent enforcement, see Chapter 8). And as much as I’d like to promise that being recognized formally as an Autistic will get judgmental friends and family off your back, I’ve heard too many counter-examples to claim that’s really the case. Your family members may find your disability even more threatening once it’s validated by a doctor, or they might use your diagnosis to undermine your judgment or infantilize you.

Most therapists are not trained to work with Autistic adults, and many of them harbor very shallow, outdated understandings of what the neurotype is. Even those who do specialize in Autism are usually trained primarily in working with Autistic kids, “helping” them to behave in a more agreeable, passive fashion. Here in Chicago, I’m aware of just one therapist who is competent in treating Autistic adults who mask, and the only reason I know they’re competent is that other Autistic people have vouched for them to me. I do know several mental health providers in other cities who have confessed to me privately that they are Autistic, and love working with fellow Autistic patients.

This is an idea the neurodiversity movement completely rejects. There is no medication for Autism, no cure for it, and no way of changing one’s neurotype. As a community, most Autistics oppose attempts to “fix” us. There are some modifications that can be made to existing therapeutic methods, to make them a better fit for Autistic adults, but unless a provider takes the time to self-educate, they may be unaware such modified treatments exist.

I prefer the terms self-determination or self-realization to self-diagnosis, because I believe it’s more sensible to view Autistic identity through a social lens than a strictly medical one.[75] Diagnosis is a gatekeeping process, and it slams its heavy bars in the face of anyone who is too poor, too busy, too Black, too feminine, too queer, and too gender nonconforming, among others. The Autistics who lack access to fair diagnoses need solidarity and justice the most desperately out of all of us, and we can’t just shut them out.\n",

Being identified formally as disabled is very much a double-edged sword; a diagnosis can even be used against you in divorce proceedings or child custody cases, or to force a legal adult under a financial conservatorship. This doesn’t mean I would recommend against pursuing diagnosis in all cases. I know masked Autistic parents who are very glad their Autistic children got assessed and diagnosed when they were young. For many Autistic parents, it’s the diagnosis of their children that kicks off their own exploration of an Autistic identity. Having a recognized diagnosis of Autism in the family can also ensure that professionals take your suspicion you’re Autistic more seriously (that certainly has been true in my case).\n",

This is true of the adults who have successfully pursued formal diagnosis for themselves as well. Unfortunately, Autistic people are frequently put in the position of having to educate our own health care providers. Autistic children in particular need strong advocates in their corner, fighting to make sure their boundaries are respected and that any treatment they are given is actually in their best interest. If you wish to get diagnosed, or wish for your child to be, you should go into the process with accurate expectations, armed with as much information as possible, and ready to fight or switch providers multiple times if needed.\n",

Our deviance from the norm doesn’t have to be the core part of how we understand ourselves. We can push for social norms to be widened, until we reach the point that Autism is viewed as a neutral fact about a person’s being, on par with needing glasses or having freckles.

Disability is not a bad word, because being disabled is not a shameful thing. We are not “differently abled”—we are disabled, robbed of empowerment and agency in a world that is not built for us. “Differently abled,” “handi-capable,” and similar euphemisms were created in the 1980s by the abled parents of disabled children, who wished to minimize their children’s marginalized status. These terms were popularized further by politicians[76] who similarly felt uncomfortable acknowledging disabled people’s actual experiences of oppression.[77] These words obscure reality and reflect a discomfort many people have with disabled bodies and brains. A person who is completely blind is not “differently sighted”—they lack an ability that other people have, in a world that was designed by and for people who can see. The world actively dis-ables people by failing to provide accommodations they need. Naming the reality of disability shows respect for disabled people and awareness of how we are oppressed. “Differently abled” attempts to erase that behind a cutesy euphemism, and many of us find the term offensive.\n",

I also know many clinicians and social workers who tell me that when they were in school, they were taught to always separate a person’s disability from their identity in this way.\n",

However, phrases like “person with Autism” distance a person’s disabled status from their humanity in a way that can be quite harmful. Autism is not a thing that is added on to a person—it’s integral to their life and cannot be removed from who they are. We don’t call Asian people “people with Asianness” and we don’t call gay folks “people with homosexuality” because we recognize it is respectful to view these identities as parts of their personhood. Language such as “identifies as Autistic” can also come across as dubious. If I really respect a trans woman’s gender, for example, I wouldn’t say “this person identifies as a woman.” I’d simply say, “she’s a woman” and leave it at that.\n",
      "当人们使用以人为本的语言时，他们经常说这是因为他们不想让残疾人被他们的残疾定义。然而，“患有自闭症的人”这样的说法会将一个人的残疾状况与他们的人性分开，这种做法可能是非常有害的。自闭症不是附加在一个人身上的东西--它是他们生命中不可分割的一部分，不能从他们的身上剥离。我们不把亚洲人称为“患有亚洲特色”，也不称同性恋者为“患有同性恋”，因为我们认为把这些身份看作是他们个性的一部分是尊重的。像“认为自己患有自闭症”这样的语言也可能显得可疑。例如，如果我真的尊重一个变性女性的性别，我不会说“这个人认为自己是一个女人”。我会简单地说，“她是一个女人”，就此打住。\n",

The word bisexual was once a mental illness label,[80] but we don’t tell bisexual people they can’t use it because of its offensive history. When someone like folklorist Anand Prahlad writes a book like The Secret Life of a Black Aspie, it’s clear his use of the term “Aspergers” is not intended to reinforce old, white supremacist notions of what the disability is. I find it’s far more important to question the belief that supposedly “higher functioning” Autistic lives matter more than others than it is to scrub all people’s language of outdated or problematic terms. Additionally, it is vital that the disability self-advocacy community remain accessible to all people of all ability levels. That requires we extend grace and understanding to people who don’t communicate exactly the way we might like them to.\n",
      "自闭症患者是一个多样化的群体，虽然我们并不必全部同意哪些术语可以使用或不使用来指代我们自己。如果你是自闭症患者，你可以决定哪种语言最适合你。例如，有些人更喜欢使用“处于谱系”这个词汇，而不是严格的自闭症。还有一些人认为自己患有阿斯伯格症，尽管这种障碍标签已经不存在了，而且源于汉斯·阿斯伯格的优生主义研究。我认识到，过去被强制使用这个术语的人可能会对它产生相应的依恋或希望重新拥有它。例如，双性恋之前曾经是一种精神疾病标签，但我们并不告诉双性恋者他们不能使用它，因为它的历史具有冒犯性。当民俗学家Anand Prahlad写了《一位黑人阿斯伯格者的秘密生活》这样的书，他所使用的“阿斯伯格”这个词汇显然不是为了强化旧有的白人至上主义观念。我发现，质疑所谓“高功能”的自闭症患者是否比其他人更重要，这比将所有人的语言从过时或有问题的术语中剔除更为重要。此外，残疾自我倡导社区必须对所有能力水平的人都开放。这需要我们向那些不以我们喜欢的方式沟通的人展示宽容和理解。\n",

That’s a big problem. At the same time, function labels can occasionally be used to highlight the fact that those of us who can talk, dress ourselves, or hide our meltdowns have social privileges other Autistic people do not have. I don’t function “highly” in every single realm of my life, but I am able to get by more easily than many other Autistics. My acceptance in society is conditional on my behaving respectably and being productive. That’s really a deeply ableist reality, but I shouldn’t pretend it isn’t true. Though having to mask as a desirable, respectable person can be very soul-crushing, it does protect me from physical violence, institutionalization, poverty, and loneliness. I can understand why my friend Angel believes it’s worth pointing out that his life as a nonspeaking person with intellectual disabilities is really different from mine. Angel says he is low functioning, and says that he has severe Autism; though some in our community find that offensive, I stand by his right to name his own experience.\n",
      "虽然大部分社区都不鼓励使用这样的术语，但一些自闭症患者确实认同“低功能”或“严重自闭症”。功能标签过分简化了自闭症的经历，并暗示我们应该按照我们的生产力和独立性来定义。这是一个很大的问题。同时，功能标签有时可以用来凸显那些能够说话、穿衣服或控制情绪的人比其他自闭症人拥有社交特权的事实。我并不是在我生命中的每个领域都很“高效”，但我比许多其他自闭症人更容易度过。我的社会接受取决于我能否表现得体，并具备生产力。这实际上是一个深层次的障碍主义现实，但我不应该假装它不是真的。虽然必须以一个让人愉悦、受人尊敬的形象呈现自己可能会让人内心崩溃，但它确实可以保护我免受身体暴力、机构化、贫困和孤独的伤害。我理解我的朋友安杰尔认为他身为一个智力障碍的非语言表达者的生活与我的生活真的很不同。安杰尔说他功能较低，他有严重的自闭症；虽然我们社区中的一些人认为这是冒犯的，但我支持他自己的体验结论。\n",

Our disagreements show that the Autistic community is diverse, filled with people who form their own opinions and speak their minds. We’re not a monolithic group, and our individual journeys shape how we express our identities to the world. I’ve done my best in this book to honor the terminology each individual Autistic person uses for themselves. This means that sometimes I’ll call someone a “person with Autism” or a “low-functioning” person, even though self-advocacy groups have good reasons to discourage allistics from using such words thoughtlessly. If someone self-identifies as an Aspie or as having Asperger’s, I’ll accurately reflect that as well.

Masked Autism and being a closeted gender minority often go hand in hand, and the experiences share a lot of features. The baffled families of transgender people and adult Autistics alike tend to claim there “were no signs” of these identities when the person was young.[1] In actuality, there were often many signs, which the child’s family either did not know to look for, or didn’t wish to see.[2] Signs of nonconformity were likely met with admonishment, “helpful” condescending corrections (“you look so unhappy, please smile!”), or by freezing the child out until they conformed. Bobbi was sarcastically complimented quite often, not just for their hair, but for how they carried themselves, spoke, thought, and for the comfortable, practical ways that they dressed. As they grew older, they began to figure out what was expected of them, and shifted their gender presentation to be more feminine so they could be seen as fully human.\n",

On the flip side, when Autistic girls have meltdowns, it tends to get written off as an emotional outburst. When they do act out or behave aggressively, they’re more likely to be punished severely for not being ladylike, resulting in them learning to censor their aggression at an earlier age than most boys do.[5] Adults speak to young girls using more emotion-related words than they do when speaking to boys,[6] which means Autistic girls often get a leg up in social and relational skills. Much of the play that girls stereotypically engage in (and are encouraged to engage in) involves mimicking adult social interactions, such as playing house or pretending to run a store.[7] As a result many Autistic girls learn how to fake their way through routine conversations at a younger age than boys do.\n",

We erect rigid rules around our lives to manage stress and make an unpredictable social world feel a little less scary: make eye contact for this many seconds, eat this easy-to-prepare meal at this time of day, never talk about yourself for too long.

It offers a very broad, very gendered list of traits that reflect a lot of cultural biases and assumptions. What does it mean, for example, to “seem youthful”? Would a large, hairy man who loves collecting Funkopop toys but also enjoys MMA fighting be considered youthful? Or would that label instead apply to a petite woman who wears dresses and speaks in a high-pitched voice about her love of horses? All too often, the difference between who gets perceived as an innocent, shy Autistic and who gets viewed as creepy, awkward, and obviously disabled is more a function of things like race, gender, and body size than it is any innate difference in personality or behavior. There is no objective definition of what makes someone moody or a social chameleon, either.

I felt more like a mystical fairy creature dropped into the wrong reality than I felt like a “female,” or even a human being. I played Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and recognized myself for the first time in the game’s wordless, androgynous protagonist Link. He didn’t speak, and didn’t belong in the community of childlike elves he’d been raised in. His difference was what marked him as special and destined to save the world. Link was brave, strong, and softly pretty, all at the same time. He was clueless and ineffectual in most social situations, but that didn’t keep him from doing important things or from being met with gratitude and affection everywhere he went. I loved absolutely everything about Link, and modeled my own style after him for many years. I wore tunic-style dresses and kept my hair long and blond, which read as “feminine” enough to other people that they rewarded me for correctly playing the role of an attractive girl. But in actuality, it was a sneaky way to cosplay as my favorite male video game character every day without consequence. On family camping trips that were uncomfortably bug-ridden, hot, and socially overwhelming, I wandered the woods, pretending I was Link on an adventure across Hyrule. I desperately needed a model of how to be comfortable in my own skin, and Link was there when nothing else was available.\n"

Identifying outside of the binary (and outside of humanity) also helps many of us put a name to how detached we feel from society, and from our bodies.

Transphobic people often take the strong association between gender variance and Autism as a sign that we aren’t “really” trans, we’re “just” Autistic and confused.[19] They presume Autistic people are un-self-aware and easily manipulated, and therefore shouldn’t be allowed to make decisions about our identities or what we do with our bodies.[20] When Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling published the piece “TERF (trans exclusionary radical feminist) Wars” on her blog in the summer of 2020, she specifically mentioned her fear that many transgender men are actually Autistic girls who weren’t conventionally feminine, and have been influenced by transactivists on the internet into identifying out of womanhood.[21] In presenting herself as defending disabled “girls,” she argued for restricting young trans Autistic people’s ability to self-identify, and access necessary services and health care.\n",

Masking is a social experience, not a biological one. “Female Autism” isn’t actually a subtype of the disorder; it’s a way that people cope with their neurodiversity not being taken seriously. Often, it is women who are in that position. But many other marginalized groups go through it, too, and those trends have not been as widely recognized. Black and brown Autistics in particular are underdiagnosed at high rates, just as women are, because racism has similarly distorted how the disorder gets perceived and assessed. They also pay a huge price for being nonconforming and noncompliant, and are thus expected to mask as a means of survival.\n"

Additionally, racism influences how teachers and specialists perceive and screen for Autistic traits in Black and brown kids. When a white kid doesn’t listen to instructions and hurls blocks across the room, he might be gently chastised, or soothed.

Code switching is a cognitively demanding activity that can hinder a person’s performance on challenging or demanding tasks,[40] and it is associated with psychological stress and feeling inauthentic and socially isolated.[41] A report in Harvard Business Review found that many Black code switchers described it as a state of hypervigilance, and that they needed to constantly police their actions and speech in order to minimize white discomfort or hostility.[42]\n"

It can also make it difficult for an Autistic person to have their need for alone time or other social boundaries respected.

I can hear the elevator groaning to the ground level, my neighbor’s music thudding below me, and ambulances blaring in the distance. Each piece of sensory information vies for attention, and doesn’t blend into uniform background noise. In fact, the longer I have to endure it, the more annoyed I become.

They don’t wear headphones in public to drown out the overwhelming noise of other people, but because a thumping synthpop track helps keep them engaged and grounded. The goal is the same in either case—to make sense of a barrage of data that’s hard to process. A sensory seeking, fun-loving persona makes for a very effective Autism mask; no one sees you as an “overly sensitive” disabled person if you’re constantly traveling the world and thrashing to the music at your local bar’s metal night. It might even be an enjoyable mask to wear, though needing to constantly seek out stimulation can prove limiting. In their essay “Autistic People Party, Too,” the writer Jesse Meadows describes how a drinking, drugging party-girl persona helped them fit in with other people and find a modicum of sensory comfort.[67] Eventually, though, that lifestyle proved unsustainable, and they had to learn to seek novelty and stimulation in healthier ways.\n",

The layout is clearly marked, the food is bland yet filling, every attraction is over in a matter of minutes, and the signage is big and clear.

A disorder is a cluster of symptoms and traits that tend to go together, but don’t always, and the way those clusters get organized tends to change over time. Psychologists have been debating for decades whether anxiety and depression should be considered elements of the same disorder, for example, or looked at as separate conditions that are just correlated.[70] Psychiatrists in the 1940s believed Autism was a form of childhood schizophrenia,[71] but they certainly don’t see it that way now. Our understandings of these labels are constantly in flux, and who gets stuck with a particular label varies across time and cultural context.\n",

Therapy that is focused on battling “irrational beliefs,” such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), doesn’t work as well on Autistic people as it does on neurotypicals.[72] One reason for that is many of the fears and inhibitions of Autistic people are often entirely reasonable, and rooted in a lifetime of painful experiences. We tend to be pretty rational people, and many of us are already inclined to analyze our thoughts and feelings very closely (sometimes excessively so). Autistics don’t need cognitive behavioral training to help us not be ruled by our emotions. In fact, most of us have been browbeaten into ignoring our feelings too much.\n"

It’s quite common for adult Autistic women to be incorrectly labeled with Borderline Personality Disorder, for instance.[75] This is a really disastrous diagnosis. Borderline Personality Disorder is many therapists’ least favorite condition to work with.[76] As a group, they’re commonly viewed as overly dramatic, needy, attention seeking, unreliable, and even abusive.[77] When I’ve taught psychotherapists in training, many of them have shared with me that their supervisors taught them to avoid BPD sufferers like the plague, and to never even befriend a person with BPD traits.\n",

They have an unstable sense of self that’s highly dependent on the acceptance of others. They’re often described by loved ones and therapists as having extreme emotions that seem inappropriate or manipulative.[79] If these sound eerily similar to the “female Autism traits” from the table earlier in this chapter, that’s not a coincidence. Many women (and other gender minorities) who have been repeatedly rejected and traumatized for being Autistic develop an insecure sense of self, a (reasonable) fear of rejection, and big “overly sensitive” emotions that reflect the distress they almost constantly feel.\n",
      "尽管BPD被称为“人格障碍”，但更准确地描述它可能是一种依恋和情感处理障碍[78]。患有BPD的人非常害怕被拒绝。他们的自我感觉不稳定，高度依赖他人的接受。他们常常被亲人和治疗师描述为情绪极端，似乎不合适或具有操控性[79]。如果这些听起来与本章前面的“女性自闭症特征”非常相似，那并非巧合。许多多次因为自闭症而受到拒绝和创伤的女性（以及其他性别少数群体），会发展出一种不安全的自我感觉，对被拒绝的（合理）恐惧，和反映他们几乎一直感受到的痛苦的“过度敏感”情感。\n",

Usually, I find a lot of problems with Baron-Cohen’s work; he has long been an advocate for the view that Autism is best understood as an “extremely male brain.”[81] Yet in this research, he seems to acknowledge that the reason many women are not diagnosed as Autistic is because they’re labeled as Borderline, Histrionic, or Narcissistic instead. Getting stuck with a personality disorder diagnosis also makes it very difficult for a patient to find affirming, compassionate mental health care, particularly if that stigma interweaves with sexism or misogynoir.[82]\n",

Both disabilities relate to a person’s “executive functioning,” meaning their ability to plan ahead, divide large goals into smaller steps, sequence tasks in a logical order, and self-motivate to complete them. Yet even the fact that we struggle with these activities is contextual, and cultural: in a world where rugged individualism wasn’t prioritized, it might not be a disability to need help finding your car keys. Both Autistics and ADHDers are easily distracted by stimuli, yet also prone to hyperfixating on activities we find enjoyable, getting engrossed for hours without remembering to pee or eat. Generally speaking, Autistics tend to perceive themselves as having more control over what they hyperfocus on than ADHDers do. ADHDers are more likely to describe boredom and understimulation as painful, where as some Autistics really enjoy stillness and quiet. Both neurotypes are underdiagnosed in women and people of color, and those who aren’t diagnosed at a young age typically wind up masking for decades before figuring their identity out.[83]\n",

Because ADHDers find rejection so terrifying and painful, their social behavior can be just as restrained and people-pleasing as that of masked Autistics. Autistics may have trouble guessing what other people are feeling or understanding unspoken social norms, but ADHDers may also be accused of being “oblivious” too, talking at length without picking up on others’ boredom, or getting so lost in a video game or favorite hobby that they miss their roommate frustratedly doing all the cleaning.

First, an ADHD diagnosis is easier to receive as an adult, though it comes with the very stigmatizing assumptions that patients’ brains are “broken” and require stimulant drug treatment.[85] Second, the accommodations many people with ADHD require can be incompatible with what Autistic people need. As an Autistic person without ADHD, I need a quiet, private, clean space in order to feel calm and focused. I also need silence and darkness in order to sleep. Many people with ADHD, in contrast, require stimulation, novelty, and sensory input. They may need the television blaring while studying, for example, or may be unable to sleep without music on. Clutter and mess overwhelms many Autistic people; for many ADHDers “visual noise” is easy to ignore, so much so that messes can “disappear” from their field of view.

First is the commenter’s assumption that because I seem to function “highly,” my being Autistic is somewhat dubious to him. He says “if” I’m Autistic I must be high functioning, not that I am Autistic and capable or accomplished. He sees the two things as incompatible. Furthermore, he seems to think I don’t really count as Autistic, because I can feign normality so well during an hourlong conversation. Another thing that jumps out is the way he equates holding down a job with having a life of value. In this commenter’s view, I am a high-functioning Autistic because I can hyperfocus on something that makes money. Autistic passions that aren’t moneymaking are, as he says, “trivial” and “irrelevant.” That word irrelevant is also particularly striking—it’s as if the Autistic person’s own feelings and pleasure do not matter at all, only how their life is received by others.\n",
      "在这条评论中有很多需要探究的东西。首先是评论者的假设，他认为因为我看起来“高效”，所以他对我是否自闭持怀疑态度。他说，“如果”我是自闭症，我必须是高功能人群，而不是我是自闭症患者并且有能力或有所成就。他认为这两者不兼容。此外，他似乎认为我不算真正的自闭症患者，因为我在一个小时的谈话中表现得很正常。还有一个引人注目的事情是他把保住工作和拥有一个有价值的生活等同起来。在这个评论者看来，我是一个高功能的自闭症患者，因为我能够专注于赚钱的事情。他认为那些不赚钱的自闭症激情是“琐碎的”和“无关紧要的”。“无关紧要”的这个词也特别引人注目——好像自闭症患者自己的感受和快乐根本不重要，只有他们的生活被别人理解的方式才重要。\n",

It also misses just how oppressive having to seem normal is by itself. It’s reminiscent of when I see a fat person proudly identify themselves as fat, only to be corrected by a thin person with a dismissive, “You’re not fat! You’re just curvy! You’re so pretty!” That kind of response betrays discomfort with fatness and fat pride, and reveals a latent belief that one can’t be fat and beautiful at the same time. But a person can be both fat and beautiful, the two attributes are completely independent of one another. On top of that, it’s insulting that a person’s beauty is part of how their value is defined. Conversely, an Autistic person can function in one (or many) realms of public life, while being significantly disabled in others. Furthermore, some people don’t “function” independently in any area of life at all, and that shouldn’t detract from their value and the respect they receive, either.\n",
      "当非自闭症群体把“能够正常运作”等同于较不残疾时，他们忽略了表现正常背后所付出的巨大隐性劳动。这也未能认识到只看起来正常是多么的压迫性。这让我想起了我见到一个胖人自豪地认可自己胖，然后又被一位瘦人傲慢地纠正：“你不胖！你只是曲线玲珑，你好漂亮！”这样的回应表明厌恶胖和胖的自豪，揭示出一种潜在的信仰：一个人不能同时胖且美丽。但一个人可以同时胖且美丽，这两个特质是完全独立的。此外，把一个人的美丽作为价值的一部分是一种侮辱。相反，一个自闭症人可以在公共生活的一个（或多个）领域中正常运作，同时在其他方面则残疾严重。此外，一些人在生活的任何领域都不能独立“运作”，但这不应该减损他们的价值和受到的尊重。\n",

The 2013 edition of the DSM folded both labels into one: Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD.

Boo’s husband, for example, has created an easy-to-read chart listing all the snacks they have available at home, to help Boo process what to do when she is feeling hungry and run-down.

Still, they shape how psychiatrists, teachers, and parents think about Autism, and it does tend to be the people considered “high functioning” who can mask the most readily, and who therefore miss getting diagnosed. Generally speaking, if an Autistic person was verbal from a young age and could fake some social niceties, they were likely to either be considered “high functioning” as kids, or they weren’t identified as Autistic at all. This is a bit ironic, because learning to speak at an early age was an early indicator of Asperger’s Disorder.[93] My mom claims that I said my first word at six months old, and was speaking in sentences by the time I was one. I supposedly shocked a department store clerk as a one-year-old by greeting him and declaring “I believe I smell potpourri.” My whole family has tons of stories like these. Many people who either were labeled as having Asperger’s in the 1990s or are considered “high functioning” now have similar stories of being hyperverbal toddlers. It often led to us being filtered into gifted education programs rather than special education, which came with both advantages and its fair share of poorly boundaried, objectifying experiences.\n",

I never could fit in with other kids, but I could impress teachers with my grasp of big words and my sophisticated-sounding opinions. Though my language was highly developed, my social and emotional life was not. I annoyed other kids by talking too much about subjects that didn’t interest them. I clung to adults who found me “impressive” and equated being well-behaved with being mature and worthy of their respect. I also absorbed the idea, common to many “gifted” children, that a person’s intellectual potential belongs to society, not to themselves, and they owe the world greatness to justify their oddness. In my adolescence, English teachers adored my papers, and I excelled on the debate team, but I was brittle and distant to my friends and made all kinds of reckless personal decisions (such as shoplifting and skipping classes that I didn’t like) to the point where I nearly got arrested and expelled. I got so attached to seeing myself as smart and accomplished that I neglected my physical health in the pursuit of success, too.

Equating a person’s social value (or even their right to exist) with their productivity is sadly a common outlook, but it’s also a profoundly alienating and ableist one.

I’ll provide some tools and exercises for investigating your own mask, and where it might have come from. We’ll also reflect on the psychological and emotional costs of masking. In the chapters that follow, I’ll introduce you to Autistic people who are slowly unlearning Autism stigma and taking their masks off, and provide some tricks and tips developed by Autistic coaches, counselors, and activists. We’ll also discuss some public policy changes that would help Autistic people and other neurodiverse groups attain justice. As the next portion of the book will outline, masking is just as pervasive as Autism is. It’s much more than faking a smile—it impacts how we identify, how we dress, the careers we choose, our relationships, and even how we lay out our homes. When we unmask, we get to reexamine every choice that we’ve made to “fit in,” and begin to construct more authentic and affirming lives. A world that is more tolerant of difference is a safer and more nourishing place for everyone. And we can begin to build that world today, simply by questioning the ways we’ve been forced to live, and choosing instead to exist proudly as ourselves.\n",

At school, she socialized with other girls, but she rarely got invited to sleepovers or outings to the mall or skating rink.

Crystal could sit reading a book for hours without interruption, but in middle school classes switched so often that by the time she adjusted to a new room and settled into paying attention, it was time to move again.

When she studied up on celebrity gossip so she’d have things to discuss with her friends, she was compensating for her comparative lack of neurotypical conversation skills. Some of Crystal’s masking behaviors were a blend of both compensation and camouflage: faking being sick allowed Crystal to hide how exhausted and overloaded she was (in other words, it camouflaged these needs), but it also provided her a neurotypical-approved excuse for getting the breaks she required (which allowed her to compensate for her exhaustion). Camouflage is all about obscuring one’s unique qualities and struggles as a disabled person; compensation is all about crafting little hacks and cheats to help you get your needs met because you can’t request the accommodations you require. Playing up an interest in football because it was socially acceptable and gender conforming, for instance, was a compensatory strategy that served Timotheus well.\n",

Someone might verbally camouflage by forcing themselves not to speak too much about their special interests,[5] for example, and socially compensate by researching a friend’s Facebook posts before meeting up with them, so they’ll have a good idea of what to chat about.[6] A person might camouflage their auditory sensitivities by gritting their teeth through the pain and never complaining about it, or they might compensate for it by wearing subtle noise-canceling earbuds that don’t stand out as unusual.\n",

What the researchers found was that parents did not accurately perceive the level of their kids’ suffering. Instead, parents based their ratings of Autism “severity” on how much their kids’ behavior bothered them and required a lot of their time and attention. Many children described by parents as “high functioning” were quietly coping with debilitating sensory pain, or were falling behind academically or socially in significant ways. This carries over to how Autistic adults are perceived, and the expectations that neurotypical institutions place on us to appear “normal.”\n",
      "研究人员扎布洛茨基、布莱姆利特和布伦伯格致力于了解家长如何看待他们孩子自闭症状的“严重程度”[9]。他们调查了近千个抚养自闭症孩子的家庭，并测定了孩子们自身的自闭症症状严重程度。研究人员发现，家长并没有准确地感知孩子的痛苦程度。相反，家长们的自闭症“严重程度”评级是基于孩子的行为对他们的困扰程度和所需的时间和注意力程度。许多被家长描述为“高功能”的孩子其实在默默地应对令人难受的感官疼痛或在学业或社交方面明显落后。这也影响了自闭症成年人的感知，以及其他神经类型机构对我们表现“正常”的期望。\n",

ABA is focused on training Autistic kids to fake a neurotypical personality. It’s a behavioral therapy, not a cognitive or emotional one. As long as the Autistic child’s outward actions change and become less “disruptive” or more “normal,” it doesn’t really matter to the ABA therapist what’s going on between the kid’s ears.\n",

ABA patients get sprayed in the face with water (or on the tongue with vinegar) for failing to make eye contact, or for talking too much about their special interests. If a child engages in echolalia (phrase repeating), chews on their fingers, or flaps their hands, they’ll be punished, even if they find these impulses painful to restrain. ABA patients are also forced to rehearse compensation strategies. They’re made to sit still for hours until they parrot back a conversational script correctly, and aren’t allowed to get up and play until they provide an “adequate” amount of eye contact.[10] They may be asked to repeat conversational niceties like “please” and “thank you” over and over until they hit on the correct tone of voice, or be told to stand up and sit down repeatedly while the therapist snaps their fingers at them like they’re a trained dog. When Autistic kids act out or demand attention, ABA therapists are supposed to withdraw, leaving the room or ignoring their distress. This teaches the Autistic child not to expect any help from the outside world.\n"

It’s akin to evaluating how “effective” a depression treatment is by asking the depressed person’s boss how they are performing, rather than checking in with the depressed person themselves.

To maintain their masks and compensate for the challenges they’re facing, many Autistic people fall back on an array of destructive and compulsive coping mechanisms, including substance abuse, calorie restriction, excessive exercise, emotional codependency, and even joining cults. I think if we want to really confront the role the mask has played in our lives and work on parting with it, it’s important we face just how unsustainable and costly masking has been. We sacrifice a lot of our well-being and individuality in order to seem “normal.” In the next chapter, I’ll review the research showing how damaging that is, and share the stories of a few Autistic adults who’ve begun to question whether all the effort they’ve been putting into compensation and camouflage has really been worth it.\n",
      "采用这些策略会带来巨大的心理后果，远远超出我们已经讨论过的焦虑、抑郁和倦怠。为了保持面具并弥补他们所面临的挑战，许多自闭症患者会采用一系列破坏性和强制性的应对机制，包括滥用物质、限制卡路里、过度运动、情感共依赖甚至加入邪教。我认为，如果我们真正想要面对面具在我们生活中扮演的角色，并努力与之分手，那么重要的是我们要面对使用面具的不可持续性和代价。我们为了显得“正常”而牺牲了很多我们的健康和个性。在下一章中，我将回顾研究表明的这种破坏性，分享一些自闭症成年人开始质疑他们一直为补偿和伪装付出的所有努力真的值得吗的故事。\n",

Some self-harm in order to regulate their anxiety or sensory overwhelm. Others become so lonesome they seek out approval from high-control groups and cults, or find themselves trapped in abusive domestic relationships they are unable to escape. Even many mental health professionals are unaware that these disorders and self-destructive behaviors are highly comorbid with Autism. The stereotype that Autistic people are withdrawn “losers” who just sit at home on the computer all day runs very deep, and it prevents many of us from recognizing ourselves and understanding the roots of our struggles. It’s hard for many masked Autistic people to recognize that being a hard-drinking party animal who routinely gets swept away in abusive relationships can be a sign they are struggling with an unrecognized disability. When we compensate in those ways, we often believe it’s because we’re just toxic, weak-willed people.\n",

A method that may have worked pretty harmlessly for a while, like drinking a beer before going out with friends, may sometimes morph into something more compulsive, like sneaking drinks at work. Or drinking might only become a problem during times of high stress. Excessive exercise can be both a useful way to calm yourself down when you’re on the verge of a meltdown, and a compulsive habit that is damaging your joints. These things aren’t binary.

I’ve already described how the bottom-up nature of Autistic sensory processing leads to us being overstimulated and easily distracted by things like ambient noise and visual clutter. There is an additional neurological feature of Autism that contributes to our sensory issues and meltdowns in a significant way—our difficulty adjusting to a stimulus over time.\n",

Their neurons become less likely to be activated by a cue the longer they are around it. The exact opposite is true for Autistic people: the longer we are around a stimulus, the more it bothers us.[2] As I’ve already mentioned, our neurons are also “hyperexcitable,” meaning our senses get set off more easily by small input that neurotypicals don’t even notice, such as a hair falling into our face or a pile of mail being left on our desk.[3] We’re better at noticing small details and changes in our environment,[4] which can be a real advantage for meticulous work (like programming, Thomas’s profession), but we are also more prone to being startled or distracted.[5]\n",
      "正常的大脑会参与感官适应和习惯化：它们越长时间处于某种声音、气味、质地或视觉刺激的环境中，大脑就越能学会忽视它并让其淡化到背景中。它们的神经元在周围环境中时，被刺激的可能性会减少。但是，对于自闭症患者来说，情况正好相反：我们在刺激物旁待得越久，就越困扰。我们的神经元也是“超度兴奋”的，这意味着我们的感觉比正常人更容易被小的刺激物触发，这些刺激物正常人可能根本不会注意到，如头发落在脸上或桌子上留下的一堆文件。我们更善于注意环境中的细节和变化，这对于精密工作（如编程，托马斯的职业）是一个真正的优势，但我们也更容易受到惊吓或分心。\n",

Sensory overload can look like a temper tantrum or a crying fit, it can take the form of a shutdown or meltdown, or it can present as the Autistic person becoming confused and responding to questions in routinized or nonsensical ways. Sensory overload makes it hard to complete complex tasks, think through things rationally, or manage emotions. When we’re overloaded, we become irritable, or filled with despair; we might even start self-harming to get an endorphin rush or ground ourselves. Our bodies are visibly tense with anxiety, and we’re difficult to engage with during these times. What non-Autistic folks often don’t realize is that Autistic people experience intense sensory input as if it were physical pain.[6]\n",

When I find myself stomping around the house anxiously, pounding on the floor with a broom to get my neighbor to turn down her music, I feel like I’m being “crazy.” My partner knows I’m not making this stuff up, and he tries his best to be accommodating and patient.

Very few of these reactions are socially acceptable, so I’ve mostly resorted to them in private. In recent years, I’ve learned how to prevent these meltdowns before they occur, by giving myself lots of quiet time alone, and extricating myself from stressful situations before they make me bubble up with anxiety. The second I feel myself suppressing frustration that I feel I don’t deserve to voice, I know I need to get out of the area. However, once a true meltdown hits there’s very little I can do—I need to either escape the situation, or find an outlet for all my energy.

When you’re used to carefully monitoring and modulating your actions all the time, a stiff drink can help you let your guard down, and momentarily relax.[9] Social norms are loosened when people are drinking. Drunk allistic people talk for too long and interrupt one another, too! If you say something weird at a party, drunk people might forget it even happened. The ease of being around other drunk people can itself be kind of intoxicating. Unfortunately, relying on substances in order to feel at ease or connected can rapidly become self-destructive.\n",

A lot of factors account for this. Some maskers believe that being conventionally pretty and thin will help them blend in. Others neglect their physical needs because they’ve mentally detached from their bodies. Purging can be used to self-harm, or to regulate a disrupted sensory system. It floods the body with endorphins, which can be calming and addictive. In one video, Dorian describes how a friend from the pro-Ana forums used to pace her hallway all night, every night, in a desperate bid to burn calories.

In conventional eating disorder treatment, Autistic patients have worse outcomes: they require longer hospital stays, are less likely to reduce their eating disordered behaviors, and experience more depression and social isolation in recovery groups.[25] However, eating disorder clinics and inpatient programs have started taking steps to accommodate their Autistic patients, with some promising results. Here’s how Tchanturia and colleagues (2020)[26] described their newly Autism-friendly eating disorder ward:\n",
      "临床研究发现，确诊为厌食症神经官能症患者中，约有20%至37%是自闭症患者[24]。由于自闭症在最有可能被诊断出患有饮食失调的人群（女性、跨性别者和同性恋男性）中被低估，共病率的实际率可能会更高。在传统饮食失调治疗中，自闭症患者的疗效较差：他们需要更长的住院时间，减少饮食失调行为的可能性较小，在康复团体中经历更多的抑郁和社交隔离[25]。但是，饮食失调诊所和住院项目已经开始采取措施来适应他们的自闭症患者，并取得了一些可喜的成果。以下是Tchanturia等人（2020）[26]关于他们新建的自闭症友好型饮食失调病房的描述：\n",

In their videos, Dorian says that their health was at its worst when they tried to seem like a normal, perky, preppily dressed woman.[28] Presenting as a transmasculine goth with loud outfits and intense makeup helps them feel far more at home in their body, and hanging out with other “weird” alternative types gives them the sense of belonging they once sought in pro-Ana groups. Now that they know they’re Autistic, they’re also able to be more vulnerable about when and why they’re struggling, so they don’t have to use a shared compulsion to bond with other people.\n",
      "Tchanturia和同事发现，在这个无障碍的病房里，患有自闭症的患者住院时间显著缩短，后续研究表明友善自闭症的饮食紊乱治疗确实能够取得更好的效果[27]。由于许多自闭症人群的饮食紊乱行为至少部分是出于社交动机，因此寻求以更真实、更有归属感的方式获得归属和社交结构可能也会有益处。在他们的视频中，多里安说，当他们试图成为一个正常、活泼、穿着考究的女人时，他们的健康处于最糟糕的状态[28]。以传统男性为主导的歌特文化，以嘈杂的服装和浓烈的化妆为特点，帮助他们在自己的身体中感到更舒适，与其他“怪异”的另类人群在一起，给他们带来了曾经在亲-Ana小组中寻求的归属感。现在他们知道自己是自闭症，也能够更加脆弱地面对自己的困难，因此不必利用共同的强迫行为与他人建立联系。\n",

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard an Autistic person say they wish they could just be a floating brain in a jar, or a dark, sentient mist with no physical form. It’s a common neurodivergent fantasy, because our bodies can seem so at odds with what the world wants them to be. Dissociation is also a means of controlling the social and sensory data we’re taking in, ignoring inputs that have become too intense. For example, when there are too many people around, my friend Angel says he goes away into “Angel World” in his head, and everyone around him becomes blurry. He has some relatives that he has never seen the faces of, because he’s only ever met them at big family gatherings where everyone blends into a sea of muddy, vague shapes. When he’s dissociating, he can still go through the motions of eating, bathing, and walking around, but mentally he’s not really there.\n",
      "为了应对面具给我们带来的压力，许多自闭症患者都会消失在自己的脑海中。我听过很多自闭症患者说，他们希望自己只是一个漂浮在罐子里的大脑，或者是一个没有实体形态的黑暗有感知的雾。这是一种常见的神经发育异常幻想，因为我们的身体似乎与世界想要的不符。脱离感也是控制我们接受的社交和感官信息的一种手段，忽略已经变得过于强烈的输入。例如，当周围的人太多时，我的朋友安吉尔说他会去他脑海中的 \"安吉尔世界\"，周围的每个人都变得模糊。他有一些亲戚，他从未见过他们的面孔，因为他们只在大型家庭聚会上见过，每个人都混在一起，变成了一片模糊的形状。当他在脱离状态时，他仍然可以进行吃饭、洗澡和走动等活动，但是在精神上他并不真的在那里。\n",

For other Autistic people that I know, including myself, having to mask and socialize for an extended period increases the odds we’ll begin to dissociate or shut down. People don’t literally become “blurry” for me when I’m overwhelmed, but I do stop gazing at people’s faces and often fail to recognize people I know or hear their voices unless they get in my face and wave their hands. Putting less cognitive effort into masking can help, as can escaping the overloading situation that was provoking me to detach in the first place.\n",
      "唯一能让安吉尔回来的，就是有充足的时间休息和解脱。对我所认识的其他自闭症患者和我自己而言，长时间的伪装和社交会增加我们分离或关闭的几率。当我受到压倒性压力时，人们并不会在我的视野中“模糊”，但我会停止注视别人的脸，并经常无法认出我认识的人或听到他们的声音，除非他们在我面前挥手。减少伪装的认知努力可以有所帮助，逃离引起我分离的超负荷情境也一样。\n",

It frees up a lot of energy and attention, so we can focus on activities we’re good at, or think only about the ideas that capture our interest. But in the long term, retreating inward alienates us from our needs even more. Some research suggests that Autistic people have a diminished sense of agency; in other words, we feel less in control of ourselves and our bodies than non-Autistic people do.[29] A lifetime of being corrected for incompetence and childishness affects our self-concept, and makes it hard for us to develop basic skills of self-advocacy or assertiveness.\n",
      "短期内，精神上的分离效果很好。它释放了很多能量和注意力，这样我们就可以专注于自己擅长的活动，或者只考虑那些吸引我们兴趣的想法。但从长远来看，内向的退缩会使我们更加疏远我们的需求。一些研究表明，自闭症患者的意识代理能力受到削弱；换句话说，我们感觉比非自闭症患者更难掌控自己和自己的身体。一生被纠正无能和幼稚行为的经历影响了我们的自我观念，并使我们难以发展基本的自我倡导或断言技能。\n",

Players were told to attempt to win the game, and were also asked to report when they thought they had control of the mouse and when they didn’t. Neurotypical people were pretty accurate in judging when they had control of the mouse. They could tell when a mouse movement was caused by a lag or glitch rather than their own hands. Autistic players instead struggled to tell the difference. They tended to believe they were more in control of the game when they were winning, and that they were not in control when they were losing, even when the two were unrelated. In particular, this result appeared to be driven by Autistic people trusting internal cues less: they didn’t trust their own feelings of whether they were in control or not, so much as external benchmarks of success in the game.\n"

Research shows that most Autistic people have a reduced sense of the body’s warning signals, or interoception.[31] Most of us tend to feel like our bodies are not really our own, and struggle to draw connections between the external world and how we feel inside.[32] For example, a neurotypical person might notice that their coworkers are leaving for lunch, and then check in with their own body and recognize they’re hungry, too. An Autistic person might instead be lost in their own head, and fail to draw a connection between their coworkers departing and the need to check for hunger within themselves. It’s unclear how much this is caused by a neurological feature of Autism, and how much it’s a by-product of masking and social pressure. After all, masked Autistics are socially conditioned to silence the physical needs we do notice.

When my shirt gets untucked, I cannot stand the little burst of cool air I feel hitting my belly. It’s a persistent, small stimulus that is too annoying to ignore. Yet I’ve walked for miles with bleeding fissures on my heels and barely felt a thing. Masking also tends to involve swallowing your anguish in order to keep the neurotypicals around you happy. Complaining about discomfort that no one else is experiencing can make you seem “crazy” or “demanding.” Many of us become quite adept at ignoring pain, just as we neglect our own hunger or thirst.\n",
      "尽管自闭症患者倾向于对感官输入过敏，但大多数人对身体疼痛相对麻木。这听起来可能有些矛盾，但当您回想起自闭症大脑通常是注重细节和高度兴奋的研究时，就很容易明白了。当我的衬衫松开时，我无法忍受感到碰到肚子上的一丝凉爽的空气。这是一种持续而微小的刺激，让人无法忽视。但是，我已经走了数英里，脚跟上出现了流血的裂口，却几乎感觉不到痛苦。掩盖痛苦也往往涉及到吞咽自己的痛苦，以使周围的神经典型人感到快乐。抱怨没有其他人经历的不适会让您看起来“疯狂”或“苛求”，我们中的许多人变得非常擅长忽略疼痛，就像我们忽略自己的饥饿或口渴一样。\n",

Research by psychologist Geoff Bird indicates that about half of all Autistics suffer from alexithymia,[34] or the inability to recognize and name emotions.[35] For those of us with alexithymia, we may know in a vague way that we’re distressed, but might not be able to name a specific feeling like jealousy or resentment. We also struggle to figure out why we’re feeling emotions. This trait is yet another reason that neurotypicals stereotype us as unfeeling and detached.\n",

Growing up, we’re told how neurotypical emotions look and feel. We’re encouraged to track other people for signs of discomfort or disapproval, so we can change our actions and become more pleasant or compliant. Our own facial expressions, nonverbal signals, and perceptions of our bodies and surroundings are different, and neurotypicals frequently ignore them. So when we’re upset or uncomfortable, we often fail to recognize it until we’re nearly on the verge of a complete meltdown. As we begin to unmask, we stop monitoring the reactions of other people so closely and with so much hypervigilance; this allows us to check in with our bodies more. Our reflexive self-censorship may begin to reduce, allowing us to notice our discomfort and honor it. However, many Autistic people (myself included) still need time alone to reflect on how we’re feeling, because the social information given off by other people is so distracting. Today I’m sometimes able to notice in the heat of the moment that I’m uncomfortable with the topic of conversation, for instance, or the way someone is pushing me to do something I don’t wish to do, and I can tell them to stop; other days I simply feel panicky and frantic, and can’t figure out what’s wrong until hours or days later.\n",

One common fawning tactic among Autistics is mirroring: lightly mimicking the actions and emotions of another person, trying to meet the energy they are giving off so that they view us as normal and similar to themselves. However, paying close attention to a person’s actions and feelings and then mimicking it as best you can is a very cognitively draining and distracting endeavor. A study by Kulesza and colleagues (2015) found that when experimental study participants were asked to subtly mimic the behavior of a conversation partner, the mimicker actually had a harder time recognizing the emotions of the person they were mimicking.[59] Even though the (neurotypical) participants in the study were successfully imitating the emotional displays of their conversation partners, they were so focused on the performance that they stopped really thinking about what those emotional displays meant. This study has not been replicated in an Autistic or neurodiverse sample, but if mirroring other people is so mentally labor-intensive that it reduces the empathy of neurotypicals, it’s likely true of Autistic people as well. In fact, these results suggest that all the attention we put toward masking our own emotions and mirroring another person’s contributes to our struggles with empathy in the first place.\n",

Almost every neurodiverse person I’ve spoken to for this book shared that discovering they were Autistic was a powerful aha moment, one that prompted them to rethink every narrative they’d believed about who they were. Painful labels they’d carried around inside themselves for years suddenly didn’t seem as relevant: it wasn’t that they were stupid, or clueless, or lazy, they were just disabled. It wasn’t that their efforts had never been enough, or that they were fundamentally wrong or bad. They simply hadn’t been treated with the compassion they deserved, or given the tools that would have allowed them to flourish. Naming their position in society as a disabled person helped them to externalize that which had long been internalized. It proved that none of their suffering had been their fault.\n",

And recognizing oneself as a disabled person certainly doesn’t make the world seem any less confusing or threatening.

Hand flapping is one of the most common Autistic stims. It’s such a well-known, visible sign of Autism that training children to have “quiet hands” is one of the foremost goals of ABA therapy.[1] Though hand flapping is harmless and not disruptive, neurotypical people recognize it instantly as a sign of disability—and therefore punish it harshly. People imitate Autistic hand flapping when they want to imply a disabled person is stupid, annoying, or out of control. Donald Trump famously did a cruel imitation of hand flapping during his 2016 campaign, while criticizing a physically disabled reporter. But in recent years, despite all the social baggage, Trevor has learned to embrace his flaps.\n",

Much like the term indigo child (which has been popular with New Age parents for decades),[4] spirited child refers to a somewhat vague constellation of behaviors and traits that overlap a great deal with Autism and ADHD. Parents of children with Autism-spectrum traits often try to find (or invent) a softening euphemism for their child’s differences. It’s label avoidance, with a bit of a spiritual sheen. In Kurcinka’s case, branding her son as spirited was an attempt to resist the stigmatizing attitudes that doctors and psychiatrists had about him and his future.\n",

Kurcinka did some research of her own and found that all the writing available to parents about kids like her son focused on how challenging they were to raise, and the toll they had on their caregivers. The early 1990s were an era when people commonly believed that a kid’s Autism ruined their family’s lives. An oft-quoted (and entirely incorrect)[5] statistic from that period claimed that parents of Autistic children had a divorce rate of 80 percent.[6] Neurodivergence was a horror that visited families, and disabled children were resented for bringing it into the home. Dismayed by the poor quality of information available, Kurcinka set out to create resources that were more compassionate and looked to the behavior of spirited children with curiosity instead of condemnation.\n"

Many of a kid’s most disruptive behaviors were signs of their independence and will. As disability advocate Rabbi Ruti Regan writes on the blog Real Social Skills, “noncompliance is a social skill.”[7] It’s only “bad” if you’re looking at it from the outside, from the perspective of someone who seeks to control or restrict. Though Autistic people are stereotyped as lacking empathy, it’s frequently non-Autistic teachers and caregivers of Autistic children who fail to reflect on their interior experience, and the motives and feelings that make their behavior make sense. A noncompliant child may be stressful to raise, but if you want your kid to become a strong, healthy person with the power to self-advocate, it’s crucial they know how to stand up for themselves and say “no.”\n",
      "库尔辛卡提议父母尝试将孩子的“问题”特点重新框架为积极的一面。许多孩子最具破坏性的行为表明他们具有独立性和意志力。残疾人倡导者鲁蒂·雷根拉比在博客《真正的社交技能》上写道，“不顺从是一项社交技能。”只有从控制或限制的角度来看，它才是“不好”的。虽然自闭症者被刻板印象为缺乏同理心，但经常是非自闭症的教师和看护自闭症儿童的人没有反思自己的内心体验、动机和感受，也就无法理解他们的行为。一个不顺从的孩子可能会给养育带来压力，但如果你希望你的孩子成为一个有能力自我主张的坚强、健康的人，那么他们必须知道如何为自己站出来并说“不”。\n",

Self-stigma is heavy; people high in it experience reduced self-esteem and see themselves as less capable than other people, and they’re often afraid to seek help.[8] Psychologists have studied how to reduce self-stigma in people with mental disorders like depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia for decades; however, there is essentially no research into how to reduce self-stigma in Autistics.

A review by Corrigan, Kosyluk, and Rush (2013) concluded that for a variety of people with mental illnesses, coming out proudly about one’s disability and presenting it as a valuable part of one’s identity helped reduce self-stigma’s impact.[10] A more recent experimental study by Martinez-Hidalgo and colleagues (2018) paired people with stigmatized mental illnesses with neurotypical conversation partners for a series of workshops, where they discussed mental health as well as other topics like creativity.[11] At the end of the intervention, participants with mental illness reported less shame about their conditions, and their neurotypical partners’ biases against people with mental illness went down a bit, too. This study did include some Autistic participants, though the sample was a very diverse array of people of other neurotypes as well, but the results are promising. In general, most research does show that proudly owning one’s disability can have a big impact on how people feel—and it can change the attitudes of the neurotypical people around us.\n",

It’s not actually a bad thing that we are spirited, loud, intense, principled, or strange. These traits are merely inconvenient to systems designed by abled people that don’t take our unique way of being into account.

Others are steadfastly dedicated to one topic their entire lives. We don’t have control over what our special interests are, or when they appear or recede in our lives. Being obsessed with a person or topic isn’t a choice, and does not necessarily reflect our values or beliefs, hence my former classmate Chris’s experience of being bullied for being obsessed with World War II. I often find my special interests are a perverse fascination with a person or movement I find morally abhorrent.

In studies that examine the lives of Autistic adults, engaging with special interests is positively associated with subjective well-being.[13] When we get to appreciate our hyperfixations, we feel happier and more satisfied with life. But for a long time, neurotypical researchers viewed special interests as an impediment to having a “regular” life. ABA therapists penalize Autistic children for speaking about them,[14] withdrawing attention and affection when the subjects come up. This trains Autistic kids to hide their deepest joys, and avoid cultivating their passions.\n",

Most children have fanatical interests at one point or another, and in an adult, having an intense passion can bring a great deal of meaning and pleasure to life, as well as an opportunity to connect with like-minded people. However, ABA therapy is rooted in reinforcing the narrowest of social standards and pushing them on Autistic children, in hopes that a high degree of conformity will keep them “safe.” Being too passionate about a video game, comic book, or wild animal species is often viewed in society as childish or limiting, and so Autistic children are expected to hide their enthusiasm.\n",
      "惩罚自闭症儿童因谈论他们的特殊兴趣可能是ABA疗法中最具任意残忍的元素。大多数儿童在某个时候有狂热的兴趣点，在成年人身上，热情洋溢的爱好可以为生活带来很多意义和乐趣，同时也是与志同道合的人联系的机会。然而，ABA疗法基于强化最狭隘的社交标准，并将其强加于自闭症儿童之上，希望高度一致性能使他们“安全”。对于电子游戏、漫画或野生动物的狂热爱好在社会上常常被视为幼稚或限制性的，因此自闭症儿童被期望隐藏他们的热情。\n",

People who routinely complete eighty-hour workweeks aren’t penalized for being obsessive or hyperfixated; they’re celebrated for their diligence. If an adult fills their evenings after work learning to code or creating jewelry that they sell on Etsy, they’re seen as enterprising. But if someone instead devotes their free time to something that gives them pleasure but doesn’t financially benefit anyone, it’s seen as frivolous or embarrassing, even selfish. In this instance, it’s clear that the punishing rules imposed on Autistic children reflect a much broader societal issue: pleasure and nonproductive, playful time are not valued, and when someone is passionate about the “wrong” things, that passion is discouraged because it presents a distraction from work and other “respectable” responsibilities.\n",
      "有趣的是，只有当一个成年人的迷恋爱好过于“奇怪”，并且没有机会积累很多成就或赚很多钱时，他们才会被羞辱。经常工作80个小时的人并不因过于迷恋或过于专注而受到惩罚，相反，他们会因为勤奋而受到赞扬。如果一个成年人在工作之后填补他们的业余时间学习编程或创建他们在Etsy上销售的珠宝，那么他们被视为有进取心的人。但是，如果有人将他们的业余时间用于只给自己带来快乐但对任何人没有经济效益的事情，那么这将被视为轻浮或尴尬，甚至是自私的。在这种情况下，很明显，对自闭症儿童实施的惩罚性规则反映了一个更广泛的社会问题：人们不重视快乐和非生产性的娱乐时间，当有人对“错误”的事情充满热情时，这种热情会受到打压，因为它会分散工作和其他“受人尊敬”的责任的注意力。\n",

Having the freedom to develop and express special interests is linked to improved social, emotional, and even fine motor development.[15] A survey of Autistic young adults by Teti and colleagues (2016) found that many use their special interests to develop emotional awareness skills and coping strategies.[16] This frequently plays out in fandoms and nerdy communities, where neurodiverse people with mutual special interests find one another, socialize, and sometimes begin to unmask. In a study of internet habits, researchers Johnson and Caldwell-Harris (2012) found that Autistic adults actually had a greater variety of interests and more numerous interests than their non-Autistic peers, and made far more social media posts about their interest that were designed to provoke conversation, compared to neurotypical people.[17] Autistic people are also a foundational part of most fandoms and conventions centered around shared hobbies—we devote a lot of energy to finding and creating spaces where we can interact with people who share our interests, and within nerdy fandom spaces, social norms tend to be more forgiving and relaxed. It turns out that special interests aid us in becoming more outgoing, well-rounded individuals.\n",

Masking is a practice of silencing ourselves and letting neurotypical expectations dominate our actions, rather than being guided by our core personal values. But when we drill down into what makes us feel happy, stimulated, and fully alive, we can identify who we really are, and what our lives ought to look like. In the next section, we’ll revisit our Key Moments from that earlier exercise, and see what those moments have to say about who we are and what we value most.\n",

She was trying to fit within the lines neurotypical people had drawn for her, but her efforts all seemed to fail. The instructions she was given didn’t line up with people’s actual (unspoken) expectations. It was paralyzing.

One of the goals of this exercise is to help you nurture a sense of trust in your instincts and desires. The unique qualities and feelings associated with each of your key moments can also help you figure out what it is that you value most in life. In order to name what your values are, you can look back on these memories and try to articulate exactly why each of them was so special.\n",

In the summer of 2019, I was walking home through Wrigleyville, the sports-bar-laden Chicago neighborhood surrounding the Cub’s Wrigley Field. There was a pub crawl going on, so a lot of drunk people were ambling from bar to bar. As I walked past a quiet side street, I saw a woman walking away from a visibly drunk, staggering man. She kept nodding and smiling but trying to walk away, and seemed deeply uncomfortable. The man kept stumbling toward her and yelling for her attention. I decided to stop what I was doing and follow the pair down the street.\n",

I also tend to put my own well-being before that of others, because I don’t trust that anyone else will ever value me. In this instance, I wasn’t burdened with any of that doubt, or that cowardice.

When I let the fear of seeming “weird” or “rude” drive me, I fail others as well as myself. When I focus only on protecting myself, I forget how strong I am, and how wonderful it feels to care for other people. That experience taught me that I value protecting other people and being principled and courageous more than I value fitting in or being invisible—but that I am often tempted to succumb to those desires anyway. When I listen to my values, my life is more fulfilling and meaningful. I feel more powerful, and less stuck. This memory also illustrates for me that it’s my Autism, not my mask, that helps me live in accordance with my beliefs. I was able to step in and help that woman because I was willing to make the situation awkward, and I was stubborn and forceful enough to stand my ground in the face of aggression and intimidation.

This can be an empowering process, but it comes with some melancholy as well. You might find yourself looking back on all the years you “wasted” masking and regret how you let shame and social judgment shape you. To help work through those challenging feelings, it’s useful to extend a little self-gratitude your own way, and take stock of the positive impact Autism has already had on your life. Being Autistic in a neurotypical world is often traumatizing,[21] and being forced to mask is essentially an experience of society-driven abuse. Though you may sometimes wish that life had been different or that you hadn’t been made to suffer, your disability isn’t to blame for what happened, and neither are you. It was a far-reaching, centuries-old system of injustice that left you in such a difficult spot. Even knowing that, you might feel immense regret about the way life has gone so far. But psychological research shows that extending gratitude to your past, trauma-surviving self is a powerful means of healing.[22]\n"

They see different feelings and behaviors as almost distinct parts of themselves, rather than an integrated whole they can make sense of and have control over. The person they were at school may not line up with who they had to pretend to be at home. They may have needed to create a complex tapestry of social fictions to keep their lives together. It’s easy to feel shame about having coped in that way. But extending gratitude to your past self and taking stock of how Autism has shaped your life (even when you were trying to hide it) may help you to feel more unified, as well as more accepting of the way things were.\n",

These positives don’t have to be respectable by neurotypical standards. Most of us aren’t genius savants, and our worth should not be measured by our ability (or inability) to meet conventional benchmarks of success. What’s really important here is to focus on how neurodiversity has brought pleasure, connection, and meaning to your life. Autism cannot be “cured,” and most people in the Autism self-advocacy community eventually come to see that fact as a blessing, because Autism is so core to their existence, and integral to becoming the wonderful people that they are.\n"

She’d always had Autistic friends, as well as friends with intellectual disabilities, so in many ways the revelation felt like coming home. By the time Moorea came out as Autistic on her Instagram, anyone who was going to be alienated by her had pretty much already left.\n",

But she’s approached these changes with radical acceptance and trust in herself. She knows that being Autistic has been a positive force in her life, and listening to herself has allowed her to zero in on which kinds of life are fulfilling and sustainable for her. I think that ultimately, that’s what every masked Autistic should be shooting for.

But she learned, at a certain point, that it was better to live on her own terms than it was to appeal to the masses. At the time I interviewed her, she was living in a guest house on her sister’s property, and working according to her own schedule. She found lots of time throughout the day to play with her sister’s toddler-aged kid, and to take restorative walks and baths. A few months later, she moved into a cheap, yet comfortable micro-studio apartment, and stripped down to the basics even further. She still does creative, curational work, but she’s learned to let a lot of things go. This life isn’t as fast-paced and achievement oriented as Moorea’s old life was. But it is more her.\n",

We’ll also hear from several Autistic coaches, activists, and mental health providers who have devised ways of accommodating neurodiverse bodies and minds, and learn a bit more about people like Moorea, who have stopped defaulting to neurotypical scripts about what a home, career, or life “should” look like. Recall that masking consists of both camouflage and compensation. It’s a complex system of behaviors, performances, and even life decisions. It follows then that unmasking Autism goes a lot further than just lowering our inhibitions. It means rethinking the entire shape of our lives. When we trust ourselves and get in touch with our values, everything from how we dress, to how we lay out our homes, to how we conceive of time itself may change.\n",

A study of Autistic schoolchildren found that many had trouble paying attention in classrooms where the walls were covered in distracting, bright posters, and the shelves were stuffed with books and toys.[3] Most children’s spaces are very busy and bright, despite how negatively this impacts Autistic kids’ processing. It’s no wonder that Moorea Seal became known for her minimalistic, sleek aesthetic. Lots of neurodiverse people crave spare or even Spartan surroundings. It’s less to keep track of, less to clean every week, and less to pack up when it comes time to move. It’s also very on-trend: minimalistic design, capsule wardrobes, and throwing away items that cause clutter and fail to “spark joy” (à la Marie Kondo) have all become immensely popular in recent years because it is so visually soothing and practical.[4]\n",
      "实验研究表明，许多自闭症患者有困难忽略视觉“噪音”，这影响了我们的处理能力[2]。杂乱无章的环境会侵蚀我们的注意力，使我们难以清晰地思考或调节情绪。在一项针对自闭症学童的研究中发现，很多人在教室里无法集中注意力，因为墙上布满了分散注意力的鲜艳海报，书架上也摆满了玩具和书籍[3]。尽管这对孩子的处理能力有明显的负面影响，但大多数孩子的空间都是非常繁忙和明亮的。难怪 Moorea Seal 因其极简和简约的美学而广为人知。许多神经多样性者渴望简洁或甚至是斯巴达式的环境。这样做有利于个人物品管理，减少每周的清理工作，也方便搬家。这也非常时尚：极简主义设计、胶囊衣柜、以及扔掉那些引起混乱且无法“激发喜悦”的物品 (Marie Kondo 风格)，这些都近年来变得极为流行，因为它们非常视觉舒缓和实用[4]。\n",

Marta Rose observes that objects carry a very strong significance for Autistic people, so tidying our living spaces up and throwing things away can be very difficult.[5] Many of us identify with the items we love, and even feel a degree of empathy for them, as if they were alive. Psychologists call this phenomenon object personification, and Autistics exhibit it at an elevated rate compared to the neurotypical population.[6] We also tend to connect emotionally with animals more readily than people, which can also influence how our home environments should be arranged.\n",
      "然而，并非所有的自闭症人适合极简主义。玛塔·罗斯（Marta Rose）指出，物品对自闭症人来说具有非常强的意义，因此整理我们的生活空间和扔东西可能会非常困难。我们中的许多人认同我们喜爱的物品，甚至为它们感到某种程度的移情作用，就像它们是活的一样。心理学家称之为物体拟人化现象，而自闭症者在这方面表现出比神经典型人群更高的程度。我们还更容易情感上与动物联系，而不是人类，这也会影响到我们的家庭环境如何安排。\n",

We also have to battle against social programming in the process: do I really want to throw out my action figure collection, or do I just think doing so will make me seem more adult? Do I never wear these boots because they are loud and impractical, or because they’re buried under a pile of t-shirts and I forget they exist?\n",
      "自闭症患者经常依赖心爱的物品来提供一致性、熟悉感和情感基础。清理和处理不必要的物品会导致许多人产生决策疲劳，因为我们必须认真考虑为什么要保留某些物品，并考虑可能出现的每种情况。我们还必须在这个过程中抵抗社会规范的影响：我真的想扔掉我的动作人偶收藏，还是因为我认为这样做会让我看起来更成熟？我从来不穿这些靴子是因为它们太响、不实用，还是因为它们被一堆T恤掩埋，我忘记它们的存在？\n",

First, you can display one item that represents a larger collection that’s become unwieldy. If you have dozens of collectible toys, for instance, you could put up a single shelf featuring your current favorites and store the rest away. Selecting which toys to “feature” each week or month can itself be a fun way to look through your whole collection and express yourself. You can also take photos of the objects to catalog them and throw some actual items away. Sometimes, old junk can be repurposed: old makeup and jewelry can be used to make visual art; holey T-shirts can be sewn together into a quilt. This often makes the pain of throwing away a beloved inanimate friend a little bit less painful, because they get to become part of something else that you’ll use and cherish.\n",
      "为了应对这些竞争性需求，玛塔·罗斯有一些建议。首先，你可以展示一件代表一大批难以处理的收藏品的物品。例如，如果你有数十个可收藏的玩具，你可以放置一个单独的架子来展示你当前最喜欢的收藏品，并将其余的收藏品存放起来。每周或每月选择要“展示”的玩具本身可以成为一种有趣的方式，帮助你浏览整个收藏并表达自己。你还可以拍照目录这些物品，并扔掉一些实物。有时，旧垃圾可以重新变得有用：旧化妆品和珠宝可以用来制作视觉艺术品；有洞的 T 恤可以缝在一起制成被子。这通常会使舍弃心爱的无生命的朋友的痛苦减轻一些，因为它们成为你将使用和珍视的其他物品的一部分。\n",

Marta also recommends Autistic people consider hiring someone to help them tidy and keep their spaces clean. Hiring a house cleaner or tidier is reaching out for an accommodation that you need, though Marta observes many Autistic people (particularly women) feel shame about enlisting that help at first. Additionally, some Autistic people might feel agitated or dysregulated by having a stranger in their home rearranging or cleaning their things, or they may need cleaning tasks to be done in a very particular way, and managing that can be frustrating for everyone involved. For many Autistic people, affording regular house cleaning visits may be out of reach. Some find a workaround by enlisting the help of friends or romantic partners, or by trading skills on local exchange and marketplace groups. I know one Autistic person who loves organizing homes and finds cleaning soothing, so she actually tidies other disabled people’s houses for free, or in exchange for supplies she needs or home-cooked meals.\n"

If you self-stimulate in ways that might cause physical harm (for example, swinging your arms around), avoid furniture with sharp corners. If your body craves movement, you can lay down a soft mat to flop onto. Algedra also recommends using insulation, rugs, and decorative soundproofing panels to dampen noise in an inobtrusive way.\n",

Autistic people’s needs and preferences are incredibly varied, as we’ve already discussed throughout this book. Unmasking in one’s living environment means detaching from expectations about how one “should” live, first and foremost. Some Autistics are sensory seekers and crave bold, bright lights, or lots of sound, and their homes reflect that. Honoring the need for stimulation and excitement is just as important as providing quiet and stillness, and so for some Autistic people, unmasking your home may mean simply giving yourself permission to keep your space as cluttered as you like.

The best predictor of how you will use a space (and what you need a space to be able to do) is how you already use it. If you never eat dinner in the dining room, maybe that space can become a game room instead. If putting on a fitted sheet is so frustrating that you never make your bed, you can just lay a top sheet directly onto your mattress. In fact, this is how most humans have handled bed dressing throughout history![10] You don’t need to live like a “presentable” adult. You can do your own thing in your own unique way—and that means you can reexamine your habits, your living space, and even your approach to time.\n",

As we’ve repeatedly discussed in this book, research shows Autistic people pay much closer attention to small details than neurotypical people do, particularly when they have the cognitive energy to do so, and in the workplace that can have real benefits.[11] Many tech companies actively recruit Autistic employees because we have a reputation for doing thorough work.[12] This can create an exploitative workplace culture, though, where our disabilities are only valued insofar as they generate profit for somebody else. It’s a highly conditional form of acceptance, one only reserved for the apparently “high functioning” and those willing to define their lives by their productivity. However, the tech sector does tend to be a place where being direct or socially awkward is a bit more accepted, and in Sue’s case, it’s been a good fit.

The sleep-wake cycles of Autistic adults also differ, on average, from the circadian rhythms of neurotypicals,[13] and many of us experience sleep disorders.[14] One reason that we may need more sleep than others is just how tiring it is for us to be in the world.

Allistics just tend to be better positioned to push through the discomfort of bright fluorescent lights or a coworker’s pungent cologne.

When business is good, Reese can earn enough money to pay her monthly bills after just a couple of days of dancing, and she can take days or weeks off on relatively short notice. I know several other Autistic sex workers personally who got into the field because of the flexibility it allowed them. Plus, emotional labor and masking as friendly and interested is recognized as part of the work of sex work. Clients are often willing to pay a high price for an authentic-feeling social and emotional experience.

It’s equally important that we make time for repetitive, self-stimulatory behavior as well, as research has repeatedly shown that improves our mental health and coping.[21] Neurotypical standards don’t account for Autistic people’s need for time to recharge, fidget, and hyperfocus on our favorite activities.

Dirty dishes are smelly and slippery; scrubbing a sticky countertop or dirty toilet over and over is understimulating as well as physically unpleasant. Shifting between cleaning tasks is laborious, since most of us would much rather focus on just one thing at a time. We often have trouble dividing up complex activities into small steps, or putting those steps into a logical sequence. So a simple-sounding goal like “do the dishes” can quickly become a long list of exhausting steps: gather up the dirty glasses and bowls from around the house, soak the filthy pots and pans, make space on the dish rack, wash and dry everything, put everything away, all while coping with nauseatingly gross odors and wet shirtsleeves that make upsetting static travel up and down our arms.\n",
      "自闭症和多动症会让很多家务事变得难以应对。脏碗很臭也很滑；一遍又一遍地擦洗粘性台面或脏马桶既无聊又不舒服。在清洁任务之间转换也很费力，因为我们大多数人更喜欢集中精力做一件事。我们经常很难将复杂的活动分解成小步骤，或将这些步骤按逻辑顺序排列。所以一个听起来简单的目标“洗碗”很快就会变成一份漫长的步骤清单：从房间里收集脏杯子和碗，浸泡脏锅脏碗，把碗架上的空间留出来，洗干净并擦干所有东西，把所有东西放回原位，这还要克服令人恶心的恶臭和潮湿的衣袖，这会使得令人不安的静电穿过我们的手臂上下移动。\n",

To an external, neurotypical observer, it doesn’t look like we’re struggling. It just looks like we’re being “lazy.” Almost every neurodiverse person I’ve spoken to has been deemed “lazy” numerous times by exasperated parents, teachers, and friends. People see us sitting frozen, incapable of taking action, and assume it’s because we don’t care or lack willpower.[25] Then they admonish us for being apathetic and unreliable, which leaves us feeling even more paralyzed by anxiety. Neurotypicals also tend to assume we know how to complete a chore or task without instructing us in exactly what it entails, not understanding that we can’t intuit our way through unstated expectations. We may not recognize, for example, that a request to “clean the bathroom” includes scrubbing the shower, floor, sink, and mirrors, not just tidying up. Alternatively, we might not know what level of clean is acceptable, and get stuck meticulously stripping out every bit of detritus in the grout on the floor. When our best guesses at what neurotypicals want from us proves incorrect, we get reprimanded for going too slowly, doing too sloppy a job, or not taking the other person’s perspective. Many of us get trapped in a feedback loop of learned helplessness, confusion, shame, and frozenness as a result.\n"

Participants in the study were less interested in engaging in conversation with Autistic people and liked them less than non-Autistics, all based on a brief moment of social data. It’s also important to point out that the Autistic people in this study didn’t do anything “wrong”; their behavior was perfectly socially appropriate, as was the content of their speech.

Inauthenticity and a forced-seeming social performance rubs neurotypicals the wrong way. In a landmark study into the psychology of perceived “creepiness,” psychologists McAndrew and Koehnke (2016) asked 1,341 respondents to answer questions about which personal qualities and behaviors they associated with “creepy” people, and used statistical factor analysis to develop a measurable “creepiness” factor. The creepiness factor they developed included the following traits: a person having awkward, unpredictable behavior, an unnatural-looking smile, laughter that occurred at “unnatural” times, speaking for too long about a single topic, and not knowing when to end a conversation.[30] When Autistic people attempt to socialize and bond with others in an affable, enthusiastic way, these are often the very traits we embody. Even as we try to put the neurotypical people around us at ease by smiling, keeping the conversation moving, and staying present, we might be seen as scary or unsettling.\n"

People mirror one another’s postures and mannerisms as they get comfortable and fall into sync. But if you mirror someone too much, or at the wrong time, these studies show you can literally give other people the chills.

Sasson’s research found that when participants were told they were interacting with an Autistic person, their biases against us disappeared. Suddenly they liked their slightly awkward conversation partner, and expressed interest in getting to know them. Having an explanation for the Autistic person’s oddness helped the creeped-out feeling go away. Follow-up research by Sasson and Morrison (2019) confirmed that when neurotypical people know that they’re meeting an Autistic person, first impressions of them are far more positive, and after the interaction neurotypicals express more interest in learning about Autism.[32] Radical visibility has its rewards.\n",

A lot of us find the natural flow of conversation challenging, either interrupting people at the “wrong” times, or failing to jump in during a fast-paced exchange and being left out entirely. For these and other reasons, Autistic women (particularly women of color) are often viewed as cold or “bitchy,” and Autistic men are often mistaken for being condescending “mansplainers.” It’s a very challenging social minefield to navigate, because of course most women have been mansplained to before, and have been gaslit, and are understandably on edge when facing behavior that resembles it.

Unmasking isn’t a universally positive experience; sometimes when we put ourselves first, we will frustrate and disappoint others, maybe even leave them feeling triggered or upset. It’s vital we learn to navigate interactions marked by conflict, and practice standing firm in the face of negative reactions from others. As long as we haven’t abused anyone or violated their rights, it’s okay for our actions to make others unhappy.

Most masked Autistics need a lot of practice developing a strong sense of discernment, which is essentially using our own beliefs and perceptions to guide our behavior, rather than deferring to everyone else’s fleeting reactions and impressions. Maskers tend to get very distressed when people are unhappy with us, because disapproval has been so dangerous and painful for us in the past.

It’s normal and healthy to be considerate toward other people, but masked Autistics tend to devote so much energy to people pleasing that we have almost no cognitive space left to think about (or listen to) ourselves.

Though relatively few people in this sample reported being mistreated after coming out as Autistic, many confessed that it didn’t change anything about how they were treated, and only left them feeling more vulnerable.

They may be startled to realize that Autism can even occur in adults, for example, and might blurt out the much-bemoaned, “but you don’t look Autistic!” Sometimes an Autistic self-disclosure is met with infantilization (even literally being spoken to in a baby voice), or with a ton of condescending reassurance about how smart they are, and how good they are at seeming normal. When an Autistic person comes out at school or work, they may suddenly be given a very wide berth, because people are terrified of saying the wrong thing or offending them. However, meeting an Autistic adult and having a positive interaction with them often opens up neurotypical people’s minds, and makes them more receptive to learning about Autism.\n",
      "进一步的研究表明，自闭症患者自我披露的影响因人对该神经类型的了解程度不同而异。[3] 当一个人对自闭症的了解浅薄，充斥着刻板印象时，他们通常会以高度污名化的、非人性化的方式对待自我披露。例如，他们可能会震惊地意识到自闭症甚至在成年人中也会发生，然后会突然说出“但你看上去不像自闭症患者啊！”这时，有时会有人会用婴儿语言（甚至直接对患者说话）来对待患者，或者大量表达出对他们智商的轻蔑，以及他们在表现正常方面的能力。当一个自闭症患者在学校或工作中公开身份后，他们可能会突然被人远离，因为人们害怕说错话或冒犯他们。然而，与自闭症患者见面并与他们积极互动通常会打开神经典型人群的思路，使其更乐于接受关于自闭症的学习。\n",

By coming out, we help to counter ignorant images people have of our disability, but because those stereotypes are so pervasive and long-standing, it’s impossible for a single counter-example to undo all the harm that’s been done. Often, when a person from the majority group encounters information that runs against their stereotypes of an oppressed group, they respond by either discounting the information (for example, by saying “you’re not really that Autistic!”) or by subgrouping the people who deviate from stereotypes (for example, by telling them “you’re not like those other Autistic people, the ones who are really impaired.

They even said that her Autistic traits were better left ignored, that everyone struggles to fit in and keep up. This is unfortunately a common experience for the first person to come out as Autistic in their family. Relatives who share undiagnosed Autistic traits may defensively dismiss the newly identified person, saying that their struggles are just a normal part of life.

You can choose to pour a lot of time into teaching people at your church about Autism if you think it will pay off—or you can just share the specific accommodations that you need, without delving into why. It’s always helpful to have a trusted advocate at your side as well.\n",

For example, you may decide that it’s easier to tell HR you get migraines, and that that’s why you need a dimmer switch put on the lights. If saying you’re too sick to go out is easier than telling your friends you’re dealing with Autistic burnout, it’s okay to use that as an “excuse” to cancel plans. It’s also fine to come out slowly, first getting to know your unmasked self privately, then developing unmasked (or less-masked) relationships with the people who feel safest to you. A secure base of supportive people can help back you up when others doubt your disability, as James’s activist friends did. They can step in and help you manage sensory overwhelm or remind you to check in with your body for signs of distress.

Every notification we receive tends to be given equal weight, no matter how well we know a person or how we feel about them. This is particularly true for maskers, who can be so terrified of upsetting anyone that they seek to be equally friendly and responsive to everyone. It can be useful to outsource the social instincts that might come naturally to the average allistic person by labeling certain individuals as high priority, or turning off all notifications except for those from a specific group chat or app. Instead of having to make manual decisions about whom to respond to and in which order, the “strawberry people” system reinforces the idea that certain relationships are more important than others, because they help you cultivate a more solid sense of self.\n",

The quality of a person’s early attachments also tend to predict the quality of their later relationships, both romantic and otherwise, and their ability to accept comfort and emotional support from other people.\n",
      "发展心理学研究观察到，自闭症患者往往从很小的年龄就与其他人有不安全的依恋关系。一个人的依恋模式是由早期的关系塑造的，尤其是与初级保健者的稳定联系。一个人早期依恋的质量还倾向于预测他们以后的关系质量，无论是恋爱还是其他方面，以及他们接受来自其他人的安慰和情感支持的能力。\n",

A securely attached toddler may venture around an unfamiliar playground a bit, fiddling with the playground equipment or trying to make new friends, for example, but they will return to their attachment figure periodically to check in and feel safe. When left alone, a securely attached child will experience sadness or distress, but they are quick to relax and feel soothed once their caregiver returns. As they grow up, securely attached children become adults who can bond with other people with relative ease, and who can handle conflicts and challenges in their relationship with a high degree of stability and trust.\n",
      "根据发展心理学家的定义，一个拥有安全依恋的孩子会把他们的照顾者作为一个可靠的、支持性的“基地”，从而探索世界。一个安全依恋的幼儿可能会到一个陌生的游乐场周围走走，摆弄游乐设施或者试图结交新朋友，但是他们会定期回到附着的人那里检查并感到安全。当他们被单独留下时，一个安全依恋的孩子会感到悲伤或痛苦，但是一旦他们的照料者回来，他们很快就能放松身心并得到安慰。随着他们的成长，安全依恋的孩子变成了成年人，他们可以相对轻松地与其他人建立联系，并且可以处理关系中的冲突和挑战，保持高度的稳定和信任。\n",

For example, an anxiously attached child might be afraid to wander away from a caregiver for fear of being abandoned, and when left alone may experience extreme distress that they don’t easily recover from. In contrast, an avoidantly attached child may fail to engage much with their caregivers. Autistics have been observed to exhibit what’s called an anxious-ambivalent attachment style at rates that are elevated compared to the neurotypical population. People with an anxious-ambivalent attachment are difficult to soothe and reassure, and don’t see close loved ones as a safe, “secure base” they can find comfort in when lost or threatened. As adults, people who are anxious-ambivalent tend to get into patterns of intense emotional dependency, combined with insecurity. They yearn to be accepted yet doubt that they can be. When other people try to connect with us, we rebuff them without even realizing it.\n",
      "发展心理学家认为，有几种附着模式是功能失调的。例如，一个焦虑依恋的孩子可能害怕远离照顾者，因为担心被遗弃，独自一人时可能会经历极度的痛苦，不容易恢复。相反，一个避免依恋的孩子可能不会太多地与照顾者交流。自闭症患者观察到表现出称为焦虑-矛盾依恋风格的频率比神经类型人群高。具有焦虑-矛盾依恋的人难以安抚和安慰，也不认为亲密的爱人是他们可以在失落或受到威胁时找到安慰的安全“稳定基地”。作为成年人，有焦虑-矛盾依恋的人倾向于形成强烈的情感依赖模式，结合不安全感。他们渴望被接受，但怀疑自己能否被接受。当其他人试图与我们联系时，我们甚至没有意识到地拒绝他们。\n",

Neurotypical children who are securely attached check in with their parents in a very easy to recognize way, using eye contact and vocalizations that many Autistic children might find unnatural. Furthermore, many of the signs of having an insecure attachment style are difficult to distinguish from neurodivergence (and from being traumatized after living in a neurotypical world). Avoidant attachment, for example, is marked by a child turning their back to their caregiver and failing to seek them out for comfort when distressed. While these behaviors can indicate a child doesn’t feel supported by their caregiver, it can also be a sign they’re Autistic and averse to touch, eye contact, or verbal communication.\n",
      "需要在此提到的是，发展心理学家根据神经典型儿童和成人的表现定义了安全依恋是什么。神经典型的安全依恋儿童会用眼神接触和语言表达与父母保持联系，这种行为对许多自闭症儿童可能会感到不自然。此外，许多不安全依恋的迹象很难与神经多样性(以及在神经典型世界生活后受到的创伤)区分开。例如，回避依恋的表现是孩子背对照顾者，在困扰时不主动寻求安慰。尽管这些行为可能表明孩子感到照顾者没有给予支持，但也可能是他们自闭而厌恶触碰、眼神接触或语言交流的表现。\n",

We also may be punished or neglected because we have failed to seek out comfort in neurotypical-approved ways. Our attempts at connection, such as playing next to another person but not making eye contact with them (sometimes called parallel play), may be mistaken as a lack of social interest. An intense Autistic meltdown may be mistaken for us being incapable of being soothed, and taken as a sign of an anxious attachment pattern. For these and a variety of other reasons, many Autistic people do wind up feeling very insecure in our attachments to other people, or having our heartfelt attempts at connection rebuffed or misconstrued. Neurotypical attachment “rules” essentially make it impossible for us to be viewed as suitable for regular, healthy bonds.\n"

Their affection is consistent, and it shows in small gestures, like remembering the details of stories I’ve shared. When we disagree, these friends try to understand my perspective, or reflect thoughtfully on why I might see things as I do. If I say something flippant and hurtful, they tell me for the sake of our friendship, but they don’t relish me feeling ashamed. They share what they want from me, ask for help when they need it, and don’t hold it against me when I fumble in my attempts to be there for them. These friends are also typically the people I can share messy emotions or half-formed opinions with, and who I feel comfortable being weird, petty, or silly around.

Quality time with nonthreatening people can also help you develop social skills that carry over into other relationships, too. Neuroscientists have observed that Autistic brains continue to develop in areas associated with social skills for far longer than neurotypical brains are believed to.[9] One study, conducted by Bastiaansen and colleagues (2011), observed that though young Autistic people experienced far less activity than allistics in the inferior frontal gyrus (an area of the frontal lobe involved in interpreting facial expressions), by age thirty no differences between non-Autistics and Autistic people were evident. In other words, Autistic brains eventually “caught up” to neurotypical brains, in terms of how actively they processed and interpreted facial expressions as social data. Other studies have found that Autistic people over the age of fifty are comparable to allistic people, in terms of their ability to make sense of the motivations and emotions of others.[10]\n",

For my part, I suspect that Autistic people get better at reading faces and understanding human behavior over time because we eventually develop our own systems and tricks for making sense of the world. We might have developed at the same pace as neurotypicals if we’d been given accessible tools earlier on. The social scripts and shortcuts that work for neurotypical people do not work for us, so we have to teach ourselves to develop social instincts.\n",

But we also deserve to live in a world where neurotypicals try just as hard to understand us. When we spend time with people who do not terrify us or make us feel socially threatened, we may be get more comfortable with eye contact, initiating conversations, and being assertive.[11] As an Autistic person, you may never escape social anxiety entirely, and you might always be a bit reactive to the threat of abandonment. You also don’t have to learn to express yourself or connect with others in a neurotypical-approved way. If eye contact is painful and overwhelming for you, unmasking by refusing to perform eye contact is more important than getting comfortable with it. By engaging with healthy, supportive people, you can learn to open up and express yourself effectively—in a way that works for you. As you get more comfortable in your own skin, you may find that people are less threatening and confusing as an added benefit.\n",

In both academia and political organizing, it’s quite common for people to call a meeting when they have a loose sense that something needs to be done, but aren’t sure exactly what that something is yet, or how to accomplish it. My overly analytic Autistic brain yearns for structure, and my social anxiety and sensory issues mean I want most meetings to end as quickly as humanly possible. So, when the conversation seems to have lost the plot and people are talking in circles, I tend to jump into an unofficial facilitator role. If someone dances around expressing reservations, I try to understand their perspective and voice my own concerns explicitly. If someone behaves inappropriately or is offensive without realizing it, I redirect when I can. Many Autistic people can skillfully put their “little professor” and masking instincts to good use in situations like these, taking the tools they once used to placate and deescalate and putting them toward more prosocial ends.\n",

It was a miserably bleak, lonesome winter, capping off an absolutely horrific year filled with death. I’m sure that several people in the meeting had lost loved ones to COVID. Of course, during a work meeting you can’t say that the thing you miss most about life pre-COVID is a beloved relative who died. You have to pick a sanitized, work-appropriate answer instead, like saying you miss eating at your favorite Peruvian restaurant. The dissonance made me feel ill.

One person privately messaged me, thanking me for saying what I did. Later in that same meeting, I shared my dismay that the committee wasn’t considering a proposal, raised by many of Loyola’s Black students, to have police taken off campus. I admitted I found much of the Diversity & Inclusion committee’s goals (which involved things like counting the number of scholars of color listed on various course syllabi) somewhat insufficient, and thought we needed to do more to address police violence on our campus.

Instead, I’ve almost always been thanked. I have learned that many allistic people find clear communication to be a welcome relief. In the workplace, carefully dispensed Autistic candor can come in handy. Phrases like “No, I don’t have time for that,” “I’m uncomfortable with this,” and “What’s your budget?” cut through elaborate social performances and render vague matters far more concrete.

A study by Crompton et al. published in 2019 found that when two Autistic people were paired together to work on a task, they were very efficient social communicators. They spread a lot of knowledge and nuance in a short span of time, completed the task quickly, and connected to one another easily.[12] However, when paired with non-Autistic conversation partners, Autistics were frequently misunderstood and not listened to. This study suggests that much of what researchers consider the “social deficits” of Autism aren’t really deficits at all; they’re just differences in our communication style that neurotypicals don’t adjust to.\n",

Vague, symbolic communication is harder to parse if you’re Deaf or hard of hearing, an immigrant from a different culture with different idioms, a nonnative English speaker, or a person with social anxiety. The more elaborate and symbolic a culture is, the more difficult people from outside the culture will find it to navigate. In some instances, this is done as a deliberate method of gatekeeping and exclusion. Academics are trained, for example, to write in a very dry, passive, and jargon-filled way, as a sign of our intellect and seriousness. Because it is hard to understand academic writing and it’s only really taught within the academy, being able to follow it becomes a sign you “belong.” But hard-to-understand writing is, by definition, less effective writing. Similarly, the business world relies on hyperspecific jargon and a variety of sports metaphors, which can leave those unfamiliar with its macho culture and communication style quite excluded. Tearing down barriers like these is essential to building a diverse, fluid community that is capable of evolution and growth.\n"

Now I realize most neurotypicals aren’t all that good at it, either. Non-Autistic people process complex situations intuitively and efficiently, but make a lot of errors. Just think of how many times you’ve seen a really confident, outgoing person misread a situation, interrupt another person, or say something offensive without seeming to realize it, or to care. There are negative consequences to such actions, but usually the allistic person who made the error doesn’t have to bear the brunt of them. It’s everyone around them who has to scramble to pick up the pieces, clarify the misunderstanding, or smooth over hurt feelings. One of the most liberating realizations I’ve made as an out Autistic person is that it’s not harmful for me to ask questions, interject when needed, or be honest about how I feel. When you tell people what you want and need, you actually stand a chance of getting it. You also free up other people to express their needs more openly, too.\n",

Her clothing was often stained, and she got food on her face when she ate. She forgot to answer people’s texts and could only maintain a couple of close friendships at a time.

At the strip club where she worked, she could come across as personable and glamorous, and charm clients into buying a lot of dances. She was good at learning the social scripts. But she kept potential friends and romantic partners at a distance. She didn’t want them to see that her car was filled with trash, or that dishes were piling up in her sink. Keeping the world at bay was the most exhausting part of masking for her. Looking like a functional “adult” required a ton of concealment and panicked apologies. The most crucial part of her unmasking process has been openly admitting what she is and isn’t capable of, and letting people deal with it.\n",

I don’t think that’s a realistic standard to hold ourselves to. Ableism is a pervasive social force, and one we can’t entirely escape; what we can do, however, is learn to observe it as a cultural values system that exists outside of us, and that often runs counter to our personal values. The voice in my head that tells me it’s pathetic that I don’t cook is not my voice; it’s society programming, speaking from within me, and I don’t have to listen to it. Instead, I can call forth the side of myself that loves reading, writing, dance parties, and video games, and acknowledge that if eating a lot of snacks and fast food gives me more time to honor that person, it’s a worthwhile trade. I can also take time to remind myself that I live in a world that exalts hyperindependence to a ridiculous, isolating degree. Throughout history and across many different cultures, most individuals did not cook for themselves.[13] Food was prepared communally, or by specialized workers, because it was a labor-intensive, time-intensive task. Fast food and street carts have existed since ancient times! Traditionally, most private residences did not even have dedicated kitchens, because people were less isolated and the responsibility of food prep was spread across the community. It’s perfectly okay that I need help staying fed. If I were living in a time and place where individuals weren’t held responsible for all their own food prep, my struggles with such things wouldn’t be disabling at all.\n",

The purpose of medicine and psychiatry is to identify what is wrong with people and prescribe some kind of intervention that will make the symptoms of that wrongness go away. It is because of this belief system that we have organizations such as Autism Speaks, which presents Autism as a terrible affliction that steals children away from their parents and which desperately needs a cure,[1] and therapeutic methods such as ABA therapy, which does not improve Autistic kids’ happiness or comfort, but does render them obedient and less of a barrier to their parents living busy, productive lives.\n",

Due to this attitude, most public spaces don’t provide Deaf people with the resources they need.[3] It is in this way that most schools (and other institutions) actively dis-able Deaf people. The same can be said for Blind people, who are frequently excluded from public education and denied Braille materials and screen-reading software.

Often, we are dis-abled for completely arbitrary reasons, just as Deaf people are. A world where everyone uses sign language is possible, but because hearing people have greater numbers and more social power than Deaf people do, spoken language gets prioritized. Similarly, a world where eye contact is not required is entirely possible (and in fact, there are many cultures where avoiding eye contact is considered polite).[5] However, in cultures where eye contact is expected, the Autistic people who find it painful are dis-abled both socially and professionally.

As the psychiatric anthropologist Roy Richard Grinker writes in his titular book, Nobody’s Normal, our current definition of mental health is tied to the state and employers’ desire for productive, inoffensive conformity.[6] Emotions that are too large, passions that are too childish and not profitable, habits that are too repetitive, and bodies and minds that require daily assistance all challenge this incredibly narrow definition of health.

In fact, some genomic evidence suggests that when humans moved away from hunter-gatherer-based societies and toward agrarian (and later, industrial) ones, alleles that predict neurodivergence became a disadvantage.[7] For example, in societies where daily life offered less stimulation and novelty than a life of hunting and gathering did, ADHD traits turned disadvantageous. Some researchers have theorized that the same is true of Autism, but much of the research on the subject is quite poorly done, because it assumes Autism must have always been a pathology and an impairment to reproductive success.[8] We don’t really have good reason to believe that is true across all societies and all periods of time, though.

The state of California is one of the most ADA-compliant states in the United States, in part because any disabled person who encounters an inaccessible business in that state is free to sue the business for a minimum of $4,000 in damages, plus legal fees.[17] This approach gives disabled people the legal power to challenge inaccessibility when they encounter it, and the financial means to do so, rather than simply hope that an inaccessible building is eventually inspected by the state. In most of the country, it’s incredibly difficult for a disabled person to prove they have been discriminated against or excluded.

Legal protections that expand access to short- and long-term disability leave at work would also improve quality of life for many disabled people, including Autistics who are at an elevated risk of extreme burnout. It would mean we’d experience less pressure to mask any pain or despair we are experiencing. Legally requiring employers to provide flextime and remote work options without proof of disability would also immensely benefit Autistic employees (both diagnosed and self-realized), and make work more accessible to parents, people with elder care responsibilities, and many others.

Throughout European history, asylums were places for anyone who flouted societal rules, including debtors who refused to work, criminals who had violated the ethical and moral rules of the age, and people who either looked unusual, or acted unusually, even in completely benign ways. Something as simple as a harmless physical disfigurement could be grounds to exclude someone from a free, public existence.[18] We still live with the legacy of these views today. Even in the twentieth century, until deinstitutionalization took hold in the 1980s, it was considered normal and appropriate to keep intellectually disabled and visibly Autistic relatives hidden from society, and even from their family members. Locking disabled and neurodivergent people in institutions creates a feedback loop of stigma and social repression: individuals who diverge from the norm even slightly are unthinkable, and unseeable, and so society shapes itself around an increasingly narrow realm of existence, which in turn makes life harder for the next generation of people who deviate. It’s only by resisting this downward spiral of rejection and dehumanization, and opening society back up, that we can undo the massive harm that’s been done and build institutions and communities that welcome all people.\n",

However, only specific forms of contact are beneficial. After all, white enslavers in the American South had regular, daily contact with the people they had stolen the freedom of, but that contact did not make them any less inclined toward white supremacy. The power structures surrounding the relationship and the financial incentives of exploiting enslaved Black people made it impossible for contact to change the social order. This same problem is evoked when Black activists state today that they don’t just want a “seat at the table” in white institutions. The table was not made for them, it was constructed to keep them out, and thus it needs to be upended entirely so that we can all gather around something new.

Instead, research suggests that collaborative,[19] extended[20] contact shared between equals is what’s necessary to really change attitudes.[21] It’s not enough for Autistic people to be tolerated at stores and restaurants. We need to be given equal footing (relative to neurotypical people) in volunteer positions, in the workplace, and in our churches, community centers, and gyms. Those centers of public life must be radically reorganized to suit the needs, work styles, and communication methods of everyone. Only when neurotypicals are required to work and collaborate with us as their peers will the social script be flipped, replacing the pressure to mask with the obligation to accommodate. Notably, getting to this place requires justice be attained for all marginalized people—it’s not enough for white Autistic people to be treated as equal to white neurotypical coworkers; Black people, women, trans people, immigrants, and other oppressed groups must be at equal footing as well.\n",

A robust program of educating the public on neurodiversity would have to accompany the policy changes I’ve recommended up to this point. Public schools should include units on mental health stigma and neurodiversity in health and social science classes, starting from a very young age. As I’ve outlined in this book, ableism and masking hits Autistic people when we are incredibly young, and so interventions need to begin early as well. When we teach children about racism, sexism, and imperialism throughout history, we should highlight how the oppressed were often branded as hysterical, paranoid, and insane. It’s important that all people—neurodiverse and neurotypical alike—come to realize how narrow definitions of sanity and “functioning” are used to harm and dehumanize. And since mental health concerns are so common (in any given year, roughly 20 percent of the population will experience some mental illness),[22] it would benefit all people to have a strong psychoeducation starting from childhood.\n",

Gay people are forced into the closet at birth, because society assumes everyone is heterosexual, and is set up only to meet the needs of heterosexuals. At some point remaining closeted becomes a process we put effort into, but it’s a status that is forced on us, not a free choice. In much the same way, all Autistic people are expected at birth to behave like neurotypicals. If we aren’t diagnosed and treated with respect as children, we have no choice but to continue on wearing a neurotypical mask for years.

Ignorance among teachers and care providers about the varied ways that Autism can present is a huge part of this, but in countries like the United States, a lack of health care coverage plays a huge role. According to 2020 survey data from the organization Mental Health America, over 57 percent of Americans who experienced mental health struggles that year did not receive treatment.[23] For those who desired treatment but could not access it, lack of insurance and lack of adequate insurance were among the most common barriers.[24] Considering how costly an Autism assessment is, and how difficult it is for masked Autistics to locate competent care, it’s clear that mental health care access in the United States is in need of dramatic extension. At least half of all Autistics in the country are currently undiagnosed, and the diagnosis rate is likely far lower for women, trans people, people of color, and those in poverty. If we are to normalize the Autistic experience and build robust social systems that support Autistics and our needs, we’ll need to properly care for the mental health of all people.\n",

While replacing all social welfare programs with universal basic income is probably not a wise move, based on the available data,[29] a less restrictive, more generous approach to providing disability benefits would clearly improve disabled people’s quality of life.

As anthropologist Roy Grinker writes in Nobody’s Normal and psychiatrist Andrew Scull details in Madness in Civilization, throughout most of European history mentally ill people, disabled people, and people who broke the law were all locked up in the exact same facilities. There wasn’t a clear legal separation between being arrested for acting strangely, and being arrested for physically assaulting someone or stealing. Both “criminals” and “lunatics” were often regarded as disposable problems, not human beings. Eventually, though, European legal systems saw fit to distinguish between those who behaved “badly” because they were sick, and those who behaved badly because they were criminal or evil. At this point, asylums and prisons were separated, though both groups of incarcerated persons were denied legal rights. In the twentieth century, the separation between the “evil” and the “ill” reversed somewhat, as forensic psychologists began to explain law-breaking behavior as being caused by mental illnesses such as antisocial personality disorder, schizophrenia, and Autism.[30] Evil was no longer understood as a moral state, but a psychological state of incurable brokenness, essentially. Functionally though, that outlook on human nature isn’t really any better. To this day, many Autistic children of color are put on the school-to-prison pipeline as early as elementary school,[31] being severely punished for small misbehaviors, and even having the cops called on them when they disobey their teachers or have meltdowns. This reaction is predicated in part on the belief that some people are just “bad,” and that it’s best to remove them from society, not extend them compassion.\n",
      "没有消除创造它的压迫性、贬损性社会结构，就无法消除讨厌残疾者的现象。正如人类学家罗伊·格林克在《没有人是正常人》中所写，以及精神病学家安德鲁·斯卡尔在《文明中的疯狂》中所详述的，在欧洲大部分历史时期，精神病患者、残疾人和犯了法的人都被关在同一设施中。没有明确的法律区分，区分出因为行为奇怪而被捕和因为实施肢体攻击或偷盗而被捕。罪犯和疯子经常被视为一种可任意处理的问题，而不是人。然而，欧洲法律制度后来意识到区分那些因为生病而表现不好的人，和那些因为犯罪或邪恶而表现不好的人是很重要的。这时，精神病院和监狱被分开了，虽然这两类被监禁的人都被剥夺了法律权利。在二十世纪，\"邪恶者\"和\"病人\"之间的分离有所逆转，因为司法心理学家开始将违法行为解释为由诸如反社会人格障碍、精神分裂症和自闭症等精神疾病引起。邪恶不再被理解为一种道德状态，而是被认为是一种无法治愈的心理状态。然而，从功能上讲，对人性的这种观点并没有真正改变。直至今日，许多有色人种的自闭症儿童在小学阶段就被纳入学校到监狱链，因为小错而受到严重惩罚，甚至在不服从老师或发脾气时被叫来警察。这种反应在一定程度上是建立在某些人只是\"坏\"的信念之上，认为最好把他们从社会中移除，而不是给予同情。\n",

As I described earlier in the book, disabled people are at extremely high risk of being shot by police. Black and brown Autistic people are, in particular, at an elevated risk of police violence and incarceration. Defunding the police and prisons and working to abolish these oppressive institutions will help liberate Black Autistic people, as well as others with disabilities and mental illnesses. Many people who oppose racist police violence argue that cops be replaced with social workers or therapists, and that a state-run mental health force should be dispatched when emergency calls are made. The law Timotheus Gordon Jr. and his fellow activists have helped pass in Illinois, CESSA, would do exactly that. Such a policy change would no doubt save numerous lives per year, particularly Black and brown neurodivergent lives. However, if we oppose the state-sanctioned racist violence of the police, it is equally important that we examine how mental health professionals forcibly institutionalize people of color and disabled people, take away their children, declare them legally incompetent, and otherwise further the exact same societal evils that cops do. In the summer of 2021, the world was shocked to learn that Britney Spears had been forcibly inserted with a contraceptive IUD as part of her legal conservatorship,[32] and that her father had control not only of her finances, but her performance schedule, access to her children, and ability to visit with her boyfriend. These are just some of the rights that are routinely stripped from people with mental illnesses and disabilities, and for those who lack the public visibility and privilege of someone like Spears, there is almost no recourse.\n",

When you’re in egg mode, you feel ill at ease and out of place, without any clue why. You avoid considering certain painful desires that lurk inside you, because confronting them would shatter the fake cisgender identity you built in order to survive. When I was in egg mode, I wore a lot of flowing dresses and low-cut tops because I believed I was too “womanly” to ever look good in the androgynous clothing I actually wanted to wear. I thought my body had doomed me to forever be a curvaceous woman. Everywhere I went people repeatedly told me I was incredibly womanly and talked a lot about how “fertile” I looked. Family, friends, and even complete strangers did their damnedest to convince me I owed society my womanhood. My self-hatred and society’s rejection completely distorted the way I saw myself. Once I finally broke through that resistance and started dressing the way I liked and speaking in a lower tone of voice, I realized I had been lied to. I actually looked and felt great as an androgynous trans person. I hadn’t lost anything by giving up the façade. I was just free.\n",

The more money I socked away, the more self-sufficient I was, and the less disastrous it would be if I got fired due to awkwardness or burnout. This same logic fed into my eating disorder and social isolation. Life as a person who didn’t eat, drink, or ever leave the house very much was cheap and low-risk.

Every human being changes over time, of course, and alters their behavior depending on the situation or setting they’re in. There is no static “true self” that stops adapting and changing. To a masked Autistic person, this fact can be really disturbing, because we may lack a consistent “story” to tell ourselves about who we really are. Our personalities are just means to an end, externally motivated rather than driven by some internal force or desire. Someone with an integrated identity isn’t disturbed by change and variance, though, because they see a connection that endures across the many people they have been: core values that persist across their life span, and a narrative of personal growth that explains how they moved from the person they once were, to who they are today.[2]\n"

To this end, Heather frequently encourages clients to draw how their values interlock with one another, using whatever visual metaphor suits them best.[7] One client of Heather’s drew each of their five values (Openness, Acceptance, Achievement, Leveling Up, and Captivation) as separate strings on a guitar. Each could be activated and “played” on its own, but it’s only when each of the values join together in a resonant harmony that they make the best music. Another person listed their values (Compassion, Community, Creativity, Integrity, Intrinsic Worth, and Justice) as distinct colors in a rainbow.

Every single time I’ve apologized for an outburst, downplayed a need, said yes to a job that wasn’t a good fit for me, or tolerated a friendship that wasn’t respectful, it’s left me feeling soul-sick and anxious.

When I transitioned, I chose the name Devon in part because it means defender. When I was in the closet (about both my transness and my Autism) I used to be shrinking and defensive. My whole existence was an apology for who I really was. Now I draw strength from who I truly am, and I aim to be a shield for others: a steadfast, brave presence that confronts the world head-on, and tries to shelter those who need it. My values protect me and the people I care about. I used to believe that my mask protected me, but really it just weighed me down. Honoring my values does the exact opposite. It places my most Autistic traits front and center and lets them lead me into battle, rather than hiding them away. I am thankful now for the person I am, and I know others are thankful to know that person, too. And in the course of coming into an Autistic identity, I have met so many people who have gone along a similar path toward self-acceptance and openness, finally feeling free, integrated, and attuned to their values after years of a false, fear-driven performance. I want the same things for you.\n",
      "当我想到我四个价值如何融入一个更大的整体时，我就想到了一个盾牌。当我进行过渡时，我选择了Devon这个名字，部分原因是因为它意味着捍卫者。当我在柜子里（关于我的跨性别和自闭症）时，我曾经在缩小和防御。我的整个存在都是为了谢罪，因为我真正的自我。现在，我从我真正的自我中获取力量，并且我致力于成为其他人的盾牌：一个坚定勇敢的存在，直面世界，并试图保护那些需要它的人。我的价值观保护着我和我关心的人。我曾经相信我的面具保护着我，但实际上它只是拖累了我。尊重我的价值观则完全相反。它将我最自闭的特点放在最前面，让它们带领我进入战斗，而不是将它们隐藏起来。我现在感激我自己是谁，并且我知道其他人也感激认识那个人。在成为自闭症身份的过程中，我遇到了很多人，他们走过类似的自我接纳和开放之路，终于感到自由、整合和关注他们的价值观，经历了多年虚假、由恐惧驱动的表演。我也希望你能拥有同样的东西。\n",

For masked Autistics who are women, transgender, Black, in poverty, or multiply marginalized, it’s especially dangerous to think about dropping the mask. Even for those of us who have the freedom to radically unmask ourselves, there is still a lot of social judgment and the pain of past trauma to wrestle with. A single person asserting their self-worth isn’t enough to overcome these forces. A world that embraces neurodiversity would, by definition, be a place where all people, cultures, and ways of being receive the same level of dignity, autonomy, and respect. However, for Autistics seeking to achieve widespread acceptance and justice, unmasking represents both an essential step forward, and a way to stay sane while the world remains unjust. I’ve witnessed firsthand how much an Autistic person can socially and psychologically blossom once they escape an unsafe situation and find an accepting community. I’ve gone through that exact process myself. We will never be able to build a more neurodiverse society if we do not name our common struggles, form community ties with one another, and loudly declare that our way of functioning isn’t broken or bad. Much of the neurotypical world still wants to “cure” us of our difference, using genetic therapies and screening tools that would prevent more of us from being born, and abusive therapeutic methods that train us, like dogs, to become more compliant. Even those of us who have not been forced through formal Autism treatment are still manipulated and pressured, day by day, into becoming smaller, softer, more agreeable versions of ourselves.\n",
